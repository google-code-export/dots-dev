'The Asuud guard were a guard and military group of Alani origin. The Mongol clan Asud is the plural of As, the Arabic name for the Alans. After the Mongol invasion of Rus, many Alans submitted to the Mongol Empire and served the Mongol monarchs as auxiliaries in battle after the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria in 1236; they participated in the Mongol invasion of Europe. Many warriors moved from Northern Caucasa to Mongolia. Under the rule of Mongke Qan, they fought against the Chinese Song Dynasty and Nanchao in Yunnan in 1258-1259. The Alan imperial guard was divided into 2 corps with headquarters in Karakorum. After the coronation of Qubilai Qan, those Alans participated in the campaign against Ariq Boke and later Qaidu under the Yuan Dynasty. They suffered heavy losses from Song resistance when they were under the command of Bayan of the Baarin and Aju. Qubilai Qan organized them into the Jasin guard (Alan guard) of 3,000 soldiers around 1271, along with some of the Kipchaks. The Alani guard reached its peak during the reign of Tugh Temur and their number expanded to 30,000.',

Only the tallest and strongest young slaves and sub-saharan captives were drafted into the guard, and given substantial training in hand-to-hand combat and battlefield discipline. They also provided a loyal force for the high Almohad aristocracy in retaining their power and discouraging pretenders to their power.',

'Hamet Zeli, surnamed El Zegri, was the commander of the belligerent city of Ronda and its fierce inhabitants. He was of the tribe of the Zegries, and one of the most proud and daring of that warlike race. Besides the inhabitants of Ronda and some of his own tribe, he had a legion of African Moors in his immediate service. They were of the tribe of the Gomeres, so called from their native mountains--mercenary troops whose hot African blood had not yet been tempered by the softer living of Spain, and whose whole business was to fight. These he kept always well armed and well appointed. The rich pasturage of the valley of Ronda produced a breed of horses famous for strength and speed; no cavalry, therefore, was better mounted than the band of Gomeres. Rapid on the march, fierce in the attack, it would sweep down upon the Andalusian plains like a sudden blast from the mountains, and pass away as suddenly before there was time for pursuit.',
'Border Reivers were raiders along the Anglo–Scottish border during the Middle Ages and until the Early Modern Period. They were conscripted into armies due to their superb reputation as skilled light cavalrymen, although many were enlisted as a punishment for their crimes rather than by choice. Some also served as mercenaries to make money. England and Scotland were frequently at war during the late Middle Ages, and during these wars, the livelihoods of the people on the borders were devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in both kingdoms was often weak. The uncertainty of existence meant that communities or peoples kindred to each other would seek security through their own strength and cunning, and improve their livelihoods at their nominal enemies'' expense. As such, reivers from different nations sometimes fought alongside each other - although, many were neither Scottish nor English per se but had relatives on both sides of the border, and even outside the army they raided throughout the area without regard to their victims'' nationality. Loyalty to a feeble or distant monarch and reliance on the effectiveness of the law usually made people a target for depredations, rather than conferring them any security. ''Reive'' is an early English word for ''to rob'', from the Northumbrian and Scots Inglis verb ''reifen'' from the Old English ''rēafian'', and thus related to the archaic Standard English verb ''reave'' (''to plunder'', ''to rob'').',
'Dating as far back as the Liber Niger (1165) document, the term ''muntator'' is applied to a class of sergeants with rights to equal to half a Knight''s fee. They were locally based in the English Marches, and seem to have occurred some time after initial English, Norman and Welsh integration which makes it difficult to decipher the origins of this cavalry. Nonetheless it seems that the Muntators were so numerous in the Cambro-Norman forces that invaded Ireland, that they in fact were themselves the origin -at least in part- of the hobelars. This form of highly mobile mounted skirmishers seems to make sense in the landscape of the English Marches. The question is of course the etymology of the word "muntator,"  which some scholars argue as "mundator," or pioneer, and suggest a tenure of about 200 acres as the muntator fief. It has also been suggested to be "vir montanus" a mountaineer, squaring with that part of Shropshire which was recovered from the Welsh and abounds in hills. Another perhaps more convincing theory is that the word is equivalent to munitator and from munitio — a fortress. If so, its meaning will be — one whose service was to do ward at his lord''s castle. What is certain is that a type of soldier called a ‘muntator’ is found in the records of the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries. There are remarkable similarities between this ‘horseman armed with a hauberk, an iron helmet, and a lance’ and the later hobelar. The muntator constituted a mobile force of lightly armed cavalry ideal for pursuit of small bands of Welsh raiders on foot. Patrols of muntators would be eminently suited for locating parties of Welsh on foot and forcing them into battle.',

'The Order of Aubrac was a hospitaller and military order founded, with its headquarters at Aubrac in the Diocese of Rodez, in the mid-twelfth century. The Augustinian rule was approved for the order by the bishop in 1162. Its original purpose was to safeguard the local hospital for pilgrims on the Way of Saint James to Compostela and on their way to Rome. Though never large, the Knights Hospitaller failed in several attempts to annex it and it remained independent and operational until the French Revolution, when it disappeared. The monastery and hospital (Hôtel-Dieu) that served as the Order''s headquarters was called the Dômerie d''Aubrac. It was founded in 1031 by Adalard, Viscount of Flanders, who was beset by brigands while passing through the County of Rouergue on his way to Compostela. This makes it possibly older than the Hospital order of St John, but being a very localised force they were hardly comparable. Eventually it was attended by a collection of priests, knights, lay brothers, ladies, and lay sisters. Satellite hospitals, called "commanderies", were established at Bozouls, Milhau, Nazac, and Rodez.',

'A type of small, sea-going vessel used in the 1400s. They were distinguished by their lack of a forecastle, and by carrying either a square sail, or a sail extended on a sprit on a single mast. They were generally less than 100 tons, with a shallow draught, and the earlier vessels at least carried 30 or more oars for use in sheltered areas or for close fighting. They were mainly used for coastal trade, but could also be used as transports, carrying around forty soldiers. A statute of 1441 referring to pirate raids on the south coast of England contained a request from the House of Commons of England asking King Henry VI to provide: eight ships with four stages, carrying one with the other 150 men each. Every great ship was to have in its company a barge, with 80 men, and a ballinger, with 40; and there were also to be four pinnances, with twenty-five men in each. An even earlier reference comes in July 1387, when merchants William Terry, John Tutbury and Peter Stellar of Hull, and Walter Were of Grimsby were reported to have: equipped a ship, ballinger and barge at their own expense to arm themselves ''against the king''s enemies''.',

'A bombard is a large-caliber, muzzle-loading medieval cannon or mortar, used chiefly in sieges for throwing heavy stone balls. The name bombarde was first noted and sketched in a French historical text around 1380. The modern term bombardment derives from this. Bombards were usually used during sieges to hurl various forms of missile into enemy fortifications. Projectiles such as stone or metal balls, burning materials and weighted cloth soaked in quicklime or Greek fire are documented. The name derives from medieval Latin and French forms from a Greek word expressing the making of a humming noise. A notable example of a bombard is the large Mons Meg weapon, built around 1449 and used by King James II of Scotland. It was very powerful and used for bringing down castle walls. Mons Meg was capable of firing 180 kg (396 lb) shots and was one of the largest bombards in its time. The Dardanelles Gun, built in the Ottoman Empire in 1464 by Munir Ali, with a weight of 18.6 t and a length of 518 cm, was capable of firing stone balls of up to 63 cm diameter.',
'Hobelars took their name from an indigenous Irish horsebreed called the ''hobby horse'', it was a common but very swift and robust horse which made it all perfectly suited to warfare. The style of fighting which the hobelar cavalry used however was more likely a Cambro-Norman invention or Anglo-Welsh invention deriving from the skirmishes along the Borders. These early Welsh troops were called Muntators, but only really came into their own with the levying of Irish troops and horses. They were highly mobile, and excelled in scouting, reconnaissance and patrols eminently suited to the terrain in which military operations had to be conducted in Ireland. However superior the Norman knight might have been upon the field of battle, the bogs and woods of Ireland gave little opportunity for the mail-clad charge. Thus there evolved in Ireland, as a habitual part of every Anglo-Norman force, a type of light horseman, which came to known as the hobelar. It was only a matter of time until this phenomenon found its way into other Anglo-Norman armies across the Irish Sea. Hobelars were used successfully by both sides during the Wars of Scottish Independence, with Edward I of England trying to gain advantage by preventing Irish exports of hobbies to Scotland. Robert Bruce employed the hobby for his guerilla warfare and mounted raids, covering 60 to 70 miles (96 to 112 km) a day. Within Ireland and Britain (and beyond), they were well-known and highly valued. Edward I was much impressed by the abilities of the Irish hobelar, resulting in extensive use of them in Scotland, even procuring six of them from The Decies for his own personal use. The first reference to hobelars dates to 1296 in Ireland, when 260 accompanied a contingent of Irish troops to Scotland under John Wogan, as part of Edward I''s army. Not until after 1300 were there any references of English hobelars. Edward mustered fourteen at Carlisle in June 1301. The following year he had 390 included in an Irish force of 2300. This rose to a total of 499 (out of an army of 3400) in 1303, all indicative of the value as light cavalry. It is clear from their rapid adoption into English armies operating in Scotland that the hobelar met a perceived tactical need and, in the early years of the 14th century, hobelars were to be found in all the major border garrisons. It is also clear that these hobelars are increasingly Englishmen, rather than Irish. Of the 845 hobelars at the Siege of Berwick in 1319, 500 were from Cumberland and Westmorland, 36 from Barnard Castle, 24 from Norham and 45 from Tynedale. 376 English, 10 Welsh and 139 Irish hobelars were mustered at Newcastle in 1322. The hobelar became a standard feature in English forces throughout the country in the 1320s and 1330s. Muster records for 1326 show hobelars being recruited in Norfolk, Suffolk and Oxfordshire. In the 1330s, however, a new type of mounted infantryman begins to be recorded; the mounted archer. In the period 1335 to 1350, the mounted archer gradually surpassed the hobelar as the predominant mounted auxiliary, especially for foreign service. For example, of the troops summoned to serve at the siege of Calais in 1346-7, 600 were hobelars as against 5000 mounted archers. At the same time, however, the hobelar''s place within the structure of English military obligation crystallised. The arms of a hobelar were first formally defined in 1335. In 1346, it was defined that a man with £10 of goods was to be armed as a hobelar. The hobelar remains a named constituent of local forces through the rest of the 14th. century but less commonly mentioned in the 15th. century. The final reference to hobelars appear to be a commission of array in Norfolk and Suffolk in 1485.',

'A cavalry vanguard expert in reconnaissance, escort and picketing attested in Middle English although first records of the term date to the 1500s. They were ''commandos'' acting as scouts and raiders ahead or in flanking to the main force of an invading army on manoevre rather than in battle itself. Western medieval armies did not move in convoy but in a broad front which could be up to 30 miles across, depending on the size of the forces involved. This front would swarm over fields and villages, surrounding them and allowing them to pillage and enslave everything and everyone in sight. The outriders would keep watch for enemy movements but also guide the army towards high value targets. They would also hunt and eliminate enemy scouts that could warn the enemy of the army''s approach. They could ride ahead and encircle a settlement until the army arrived, anyone trying to flee would be ensnared by the outriders. These riders were especially well known in the forces of the English and the Scots who were both notorious for raids and campaigns of prolonged devastation over the borders. The English also practiced this tactic in Ireland to great effect and even in France where the limited and often isolated forces needed outriders to survive and avoid the enemy. They were essential in finding locations and routes most famously for the retreat of Henry V''s troops at Agincourt in 1415, but even earlier under Edward III at Crécy in 1346 as well as the Siege of Calais begun in the same year. The word has cognate forms in German as Autraider and Vorreiter.',

'Simply French for ''low knights'' -that is of low nobility, perhaps in rank of sergeants but related to the ducal houses by blood. These lesser knights were known throughout Europe and not least by this very name in western Europe. However in Burgundy as the state emerged into a more distinct and independent autonomy- the Burgundian Bas Chevaliers made up a fearsome core of the Burgundian warmachine, an aggressive well-trained cavalry which in fact was far ahead of its time in terms of professional tactics. Despite the reputation that medieval knights were themselves the perfect warriors of the age, in the high medieval era they were far from it. Whilst undoubtedly when committed to an attack they were generally a table-turner, for the most part knights were totally removed from the actual strategic outcomes but maintained an opportunistic focus on the opposing aristocrats in an attempt to defeat them mano et mano and claim their prizes in ransoms amongst other material things.  What the Burgundian cavalry did was to rely on a large-scale heavy cavalry that was not made up of an uncontrollable arrogant elite, but instead a dedicated force that served the overall military instincts of the state. In this respect they paved the way for the massive Napoleonic era cavalry regiments of central Europe. Despite the Renaissance''s reliance on pike and musket the rise of the dedicated lancer companies as seen in the French and Burgundian model of the late middle ages maintained the essential cavalry role on European battlefields for centuries.',

'In 970 the emperor John I Tzimiskes transplanted no less than 200,000 Armenian Paulicians to Europe and settled them in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis (today''s Plovdiv in Thrace) and it is thought that their Manichean beleifs had a major authority on the Bogomils. According to Slavonic documents, the founder of this sect was a certain priest Bogumil, who ''imbibed the Manichaean teaching and flourished at the time of the Bulgarian emperor Peter'' (927-968). The Slavonic sources are unanimous on the point that his teaching was Manichaean. A Synodikon from the year 1210 adds the names of his pupils or ''apostles,'' Mihail, Todur, Dobri, Stefan, Vasilie and Peter. Zealous missionaries carried their doctrines far and wide. In 1004, scarcely 25 years after the introduction of Christianity into Kievan Rus, we hear of a priest Adrian teaching the same doctrines as the Bogomils. He was imprisoned by Leontius, Bishop of Kiev. In 1125, the Church in the south of Rus had to combat another heresiarch named Dmitri. With the massive influx of Armenian refugees from the Turkish invasion and Byzantine persecutions, many fled into Russia and the situation was protracted. The Church in Bulgaria also tried to extirpate Bogomilism, in response several thousand went in the army of Alexios I Komnenos against the Norman, Robert Guiscard; but, deserting the emperor, many of them (1085) were thrown into prison. The Bogomils spread westwards and settled first in Serbia; but at the end of the 12th century Stefan Nemanja, Great Župan of Serbia, expelled them from the country. Large numbers took refuge in Bosnia, where they were known under the name of Patarenes or Patareni. In the 12th and 13th century, the Bogomils were already known in the West as ''Cathars'' or in other places as ''Bulgari'', i.e. Bulgarians (българи). In 1207 the Bulgarorum heresy is mentioned. In 1223 the Albigenses are declared to be the local ''Bougres'', and in the same period mention is made of the ''Pope of the Albigenses who resided within the confines of Bulgaria''. The Cathars and Patarenes, the Waldenses, the Anabaptists, and in Russia the Strigolniki, Molokani and Doukhobors, have all at different times been identified with the Bogomils. The word ''Cathar'' is derived from the Greek ''Katharos'' (meaning ''pure'') On multiple tombstones in Bosnia they are clearly shown as armoured archers.',
'In the 650s, Constans II established the corps of the Karabisianoi (Greek: Καραβισιάνοι, ''the Ships'' Men''), possibly from the remainders of the old quaestura exercitus or the Army of the Illyricum. It was headed by a naval stratēgos (stratēgos tōn plōimatōn), and included the southern coast of Asia Minor from Miletus to Seleucia in Cilicia, the Aegean islands and the imperial holdings in southern Greece. Its headquarters was initially perhaps at Samos, with a subordinate command under a droungarios (naval commander) at Cibyrrha in Pamphylia. As its name suggests, it comprised most of the Empire''s standing navy, and faced the principal maritime threat, the Arab fleets of Egypt and Syri. The Karabisianoi however were soon (by 720) replaced by maritime themata. The Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots or Kibyrrhaiotai (θέμα Κιβυρραιωτῶν) was created from the Karabisianoi fleet, and assigned to the administration and defense of the southern coasts of Asia Minor. The seat of its stratēgos, first mentioned in 734, was initially at Cibyrrha and later at Attaleia. Despite the formal disbandment of the marine corps, the need for captains'' and admirals'' guards continued, with the prestigious rank of komēs tēs hetaireias (count of the bodyguard) being reserved for their officers. During the reign of Leo VI the Wise, records show that the navy reached 34,200 oarsmen and 8,000 marines. The central Imperial Fleet totalled some 19,600 oarsmen and 4,000 marines under the command of the droungarios of the basilikon plōimon. These four thousand marines were professional soldiers, first recruited as a corps in the mold of the former Karabisianoi by Basil I in the 870s. They were a great asset to the Imperial Fleet, for whereas previously it had depended on thematic and tagmatic soldiers for its marines, the new force provided a more reliable, better trained and immediately available force at the Emperor''s disposal. The high status of these marines is illustrated by the fact that they were considered to belong to the imperial tagmata, and were organized along similar lines. The Aegean thematic fleet numbered 2,610 oarsmen and 400 marines, the Cibyrrhaeotic fleet stood at 5,710 oarsmen and 1,000 marines, the Samian fleet at 3,980 oarsmen and 600 marines, and finally, the Theme of Hellas furnished 2,300 oarsmen with a portion of its 2,000 thematic soldiers doubling as marines. After regaining Constantinople in 1261, Michael VIII initiated a great effort to lessen his dependence on auxillaries by reforming a ''national'' navy, establishing a number of new corps to this purpose: the Gasmouloi (Γασμοῦλοι), who were men of mixed Greek-Latin descent living around the capital; and colonists from Laconia, called Lakōnes (Λάκωνες, ''Laconians'') or Tzakōnes (Τζάκωνες), were used as marines, forming the bulk of Byzantine naval manpower in the 1260s and 1270s. Around 70 marines were stationed on each Dromon and amongst many duties they were responsible for using the siphones or Greek Fire flame thrower. On land, like most tzagratoroi (crossbowmen) they were normally used as garrisons alongside Italian mercenaries, specifically in harbour cities.',
'Dromons could have a crew of 200, 50 on the lower bank, and 100 on the upper bank in two files, together with 50 marines. They had a central tower (xylokastron - Greek: ''wooden castle'') near the main mast, from which the marines could use their bows and arrows or throw spears and other projectiles. Dromons were frequently equipped with flamethrowers (siphones, and as such the ships were described as siphonophoroi dromones) that discharged Greek fire and catapults capable of hurling 10 kg projectiles up to 250 meters.',

'The chief method of deployment of Greek fire, which set it apart from similar substances, was its projection through a tube (siphōn), for use aboard ships or in sieges. Portable projectors (cheirosiphōnes) were invented, reputedly by Emperor Leo VI. The Byzantine military manuals also mention that jars (kytrai or tzykalia) filled with Greek fire and caltrops wrapped with tow and soaked in the substance were thrown by catapults, while pivoting cranes (gerania) were employed to pour it upon enemy ships.The cheirosiphōnes were especially prescribed for use at land and in sieges, both against siege machines and against defenders on the walls, by several 10th-century military authors, and their use is depicted in the Poliorcetica of Hero of Byzantium. They first appear in the Tactica of emperor Leo VI the Wise, who claims to have invented them.

'The Varangian Guard appear to have taken their name from the Slavic Varjagi, which in turn comes from the Old Norse Vár ''sworn'' and Gengi ''companion''. This was the name for the retinues of the early Rus Vikings as they colonised the rivers of Russia and made their way along the trade routes between the Baltic and the Black Sea. Constantinople as early as 839 were fielding Rus mercenaries that would become in time the highly trusted heavy infantry guard of the Emperor himself, preferring them over Greeks who could be bought or embroiled in dynastic politics. The Scandinavian and Russian recruits still worked in the basic Nordic fashion of warfare, but paid so handsomely as they were they kitted themselves out with the best Byzantine armour available. After the fall of the English to the Normans in 1066 many Anglo-Norse nobles fled to eastern Europe, many marrying into the Russian, Polish and Hungarian royal families. Naturally many joined the ranks of the Guard, which by virtue of this; now became known as the ''English Guard.'' The Anglo-Norse style of fighting was the same as before however, and all the troops spoke mutually understandable languages. The Guard, although a Byzantine institution spread copycat bands in the employment of various eastern princes. These units were typically styled in latin as Comitatenses or Comitatus and were well-known all around the Black Sea. The 12th century Byzantine historian John Kinnamos calls them ''axe-bearers of the British nation, which has been in service to the Romans'' Emperors from a long time back'' remembering the Germanic Foederati troops of the Romans, but also indicating the Saxon composition of the guard well up to the point of the Fourth Crusade. Although the regiment of the Varangion was a mix of diferent troops, this unit represents the elite Imperial Guard and those select Nordic warbands that assembled around the rulers who emulated Byzantium.',

'Banu Hilal were a confederation of Arabian Bedouin tribes that migrated from Upper Egypt into North Africa in the 11th century, having been sent by the Fatimids to punish the Zirids for abandoning Shiism. Other authors suggest that the tribes left the grasslands on the upper Nile because of environmental degradation accompanying the Medieval Warm Period. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring Hammadids. Their influx was a major factor in the linguistic and cultural Arabization of the Maghreb, and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant.

'The Deylamites or Dailamites were an Iranian people inhabiting the mountainous regions of northern Iran on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. They were employed as soldiers from the time of the Sassanid Empire, and long resisted the Arab conquest of Iran and subsequent Islamization. In the 930s, the Dailami Buyid dynasty emerged and managed to gain control over much of modern-day Iran, which it held until the coming of the Seljuk Turks in the mid-11th century. The Dailamites lived in the highlands of Dailam, part of the Alborz mountain range, between Gilan and Tabaristan. ollowing the Persian defeat in the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, the 4,000-strong Dailamite contingent of the Persian guard, along with other Persian units, defected to the Arab side, converting to Islam. Nevertheless, the Dailamites managed to resist the Arab invasion of their own mountainous homeland for several centuries under their own local rulers.Warfare in the region was endemic, with raids and counter-raids by both sides. Under the Arabs, the old Persian fortress-city of Qazvin continued in its Sassanid-era role as a bulwark against Dailamite raids. According to the historian al-Tabari, the Dailamites, along with the Turks, were considered the worst enemies of the Muslims. During the reign of Harun al-Rashid, several Shia fled to the Dailamites, most of whom remained pagan, with a few Zoroastrians and Christians, to escape persecution. Among these refugees were the Alids, who began the gradual conversion of the Dailamites to Shia Islam. Nevertheless, a strong Persian identity remained ingrained in the peoples of the region, along with an anti-Arab mentality. The local rulers, like the Ziyarid dynasty, made a point of celebrating old Iranian and Zoroastrian festivals.',

'A regiment formed by the Sicilian-German noble Roger von Blume, better known as Roger de Flor, in 1302, with Aragonese and Catalan mercenaries who were idle in the Kingdom of Sicily after the peace of Catalbellota. Roger was a fugitive of the Templars, and in order to avoid the Pope and his Order, he travelled to Byzantium (whose emperor, Andrónikos Palaiologos, needed military help) with his mercenaries (commanded by his friend Berenguer d''Entenza) to fight the invading Turks. The Company set sail in Messina with 36 ships and 8000 soldiers. They were received by the Basileus himself in Konstantinoúpolis in 1303, and there Roger set his conditions to the emperor: should he help him in the defence of the Empire, he would marry the niece of Andrónikos and he would gain the title of Great Duke. The Basileus accepted. The presence of the Almughavars, who represented the interests of the Crown of Aragón, upset the Genoese colony in Konstantinoúpolis, who faced the Aragonese in the city and caused a confrontation between both colonies. The Almughavars started a massacre in which 3000 Italians were killed by the mercenaries. The emperor ordered the Almughavars to depart for Anatolia as soon as possible. There they crushed the Turks in Kýzikos (1303), Germe (1304) and liberated the city of Philadelpheia, which was under Turkish siege. They settled their headquarters in Magnisía, and from there they continued their campaigns against the Turks, recovering for Byzantium an important part of Anatolia. The Byzantines however, began to see that they had created a monster- the Company were basically the new masters of Anatolia. In July the Almughavars defeated another important Turkish force at the Cilician Gates, in the frontier with Armenia, where 18,000 Turks were defeated by Roger de Flor''s own forces. It was then when Magnisía, garrisoned by Alans, the enemies of the Aragonese and the other great mercenary force of the Byzantine Empire, rioted against the Almughavars. In the next months the hate of Byzantines grew against the Catalan Company, which had come to be seen as an army of insubordinate barbarians, even worse than Turks for the Empire. In 1305 the Emperor enticed DeFlor and his men to a great banquet as a pretext to assassination. Using Alan calvary, Roger de Flor was killed, and only 1400 Catalans survived. This small company, now commanded by Berenguer d''Entenza was furious at the Byzantine betrayal, and vowed vengeance. They acted as guerrilla fighters, pillaging and terrifying the Empire before finally defeating the Byzantines in pitched battle at Gallipoli in 1305. In just two years, the Company had devastated the fields of Makedonía and Tráki, fomenting absolute terror. The Company, after several major confrontantions were actually able to grasp power in Athens and Thebes, which they then ceded to the Crown of Aragón, whereupon they rejoined the ranks of their countrymen. They were in many ways the first of the condottieri, heralds of a new age in warfare, the rise of the proffessional mercenary soldier.',

'Credentes or Believers, were the ordinary followers of what became known as the Cathar or Albigensian movement, a Christian sect which flourished in western Europe during the 11th, 12th and 13th Centuries. Credentes constituted up the main part of the Cathar community in the region. Cathar ''heresy'' believed in pacifism but in the persecutions, particularly during the Albigensian Crusade they were forced to occupy castles and defend themselves. They referred to themselves merely as ''good christians'', and although they had their heartland in Languedoc their branches sprang up all over Europe. While only conditionally militant, they often presented a serious threat to the Catholic order, and this was no doubt down to their vast numbers. They were closely related to the Bogomils, and were sometimes indistinguishable since it was outsiders who defined their religion in categorical terms. It is now generally agreed by most scholars that identifiable Catharism did not emerge until at least 1143, when the first confirmed report of a group espousing similar beliefs is reported being active at Cologne by the cleric Eberwin of Steinfeld. A landmark in the ''institutional history'' of the Cathars was the Council, held in 1167 at Saint-Félix-Lauragais, attended by many local figures and also by the Bogomil papa Nicetas, the Cathar bishop of (northern) France and a leader of the Cathars of Lombardy. The Cathars were largely a homegrown, Western European/Latin Christian phenomenon, springing up in the Rhineland cities (particularly Cologne) in the mid-12th century, northern France around the same time, and particularly southern France—the Languedoc—and the northern Italian cities in the mid-late 12th century. In the Languedoc and northern Italy, the Cathars would enjoy their greatest popularity, surviving in the Languedoc, in much reduced form, up to around 1325 and in the Italian cities until the Inquisitions of the 1260s–1300s finally rooted them out. In the case of the Albigensian crusade, it was the population of Toulouse -around 30,000 people that refused to give up their native minority population of merely 3000 Cathars, this popularity is a credit to their piety and the respect they held amongs the local communities they came in contact with. It is for this reason perhaps that they endured so much persecution, given shelter by the common people. Waldensians in the latter Middle Ages were also an offshoot of the Catharian heresy ',

'The term Lodia was used to name Russian river, lake or sea vessels until the 15th century. Basic names of crafts in general or certain classes of crafts were: lodia, sudno, korabl, shneka and busa. The terms lodia and sudno were of Slavic origin and usually meant all kinds of crafts, but sometimes they were opposed to the big ships. The appearance of the term korabl among the Slavs was probably connected with the time of the increasing of contacts with Byzantium. The term shneka signified the large sailing-rowing Scandinavian ships, the term busa was used for the sailing ships similar to the cog. As concrete titles of the vessels of the Slavic or Russian origin can be distinguished the following names: cheln, uchan, porom, pavozok, nasad, and strug.

'Known as abid al-shira or "possessed men", the Sub-Saharan slave units constituted an imporant and reliable light-infantry force of the Egyptian sultans. Their ranks had swelled to 50,000 during the reign of Al-Mustansir whose own mother had been an African slave. The belief that abid al-shira were archers is a commonly held misconception stemming from the fact the Fatimids also commonly employed free Christian Nubian archers. In actuality, most abid al-shira were armed with swords and javelins. “A countless host of infantry trained to throw the javelin...” according to William of Tyre, an account that matches their description in contemporary Arabic sources.

'The bill was a weapon with a long martial tradition in England, it originated with the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons, as a variant of the Danish Axe or pole-axe. It continued to be used in medieval England, predating the adaptation of farming tools into halberd-like weapons in mainland Europe and Russia. The weapon was extremely effective against both infantry and cavalry but required discipline, extensive technical training and unit tactics. For this reason it was fairly uncommon in the early period, however as heavy cavalry formations required more anti-cavalry infantry and combined with the rise of polearms on the continent, the bill was applied more and more by the organised armies of the English kings. Billmen were also invaluable in that like many English units they were military specialists but commoners, not nobles. Due to its ''older'' design it had an advantage over continental polearms in that its blade was extremely heavy, although it was relatively slow in the polearm technique of raking and worse still- short in comparison it had a much greater penetration power against armoured opponents on horse or foot alike. Unlike anti-cavalry weapons and units that used a tight formation, billmen were unique in that they used an open formation and this was due to the actual technique of the weapon which was not linear but lateral and like an axe (or quarterstaff technique which was probably a training form) it used a circular and figure of eight motion. Despite its short staff it was therefore almost impossible for an opposing unit to enter into hand-to-hand combat against an open line of these heavy spinning polearms. It would smash shields, deflect polearms and sever horse limbs and men''s heads in a whirlwind.',

'The fyrd was an Anglo-Saxon levy with roots in the ancient Germanic tradition of the ''hundred'', this was also an administrative division of local government and land, still used today in Scandinavia in fact. The hundred itself refers to the feudal commitment of one warrior being chosen from every 100 members of the population. This chosen man would be the village''s best warrior and be equipped by his community with the best weapons and armour they could afford, to help save his life. In the Norman period, a good deal of these chosen men were actually English nobles that had been stripped of their rank and property by the Normans. These nobles became local esquires, gentry, elders and headmen. Which meant that the quality of the fyrd actually improved due to the military experience, knowledge, skills and equipment of the English nobles. The fyrd system dwindled from use rather quickly after the Norman period as the Crown became more powerful, and the use of national armies and standing local militias replaced the old ways.',
'The word churl derived from Anglo-Saxon meaning ''freeman'', referring to a man of the Middle Classes. It has cognate forms in Scandinavian and Germanic names ''karl'', ''carl'' or ''charles'', and ''huscarls''.

Churls'' rank diminished to small freeholdings and estates, by the end of the Middle Ages the English word ''churlish'' meant someone provincial and backward. Nonetheless they were still relevant to the English fyrd and later levy system, even if they were not categorically soldiers.',
'The longbow has a strange story which is often misunderstood and misinterpreted in the popular imagination. Nonetheless it has become one of the enduring icons of the Middle Ages and specifically a symbol of English power, dominance and glory. It is a common misconception that the longbow originated in Wales. The longbow or ''warbow'' was first used among the Anglo-Saxons and Norse, and it is they who probably introduced it to Britain. The weapon, for some unknown reason, was never really important to pre-medieval warfare and did not have an important role on the battlefield. The Welsh had gained use of it sometime prior to the Norman conquest, and as hillmen and guerrillas used it to excellent effect against armoured professional soldiers -Norman invaders, and it was at this point that its story took on a more recognisable turn, where its military effectiveness was realised. However, the Welsh longbow was in fact a good deal shorter than English traditional longbows, nor was it made of yew but of elm which greatly effected its tension, range and tolerance to the damp British climate. The Welsh longbow, was probably more of a hunting weapon. As a result of the Welsh competency, the English quickly resurrected their own yew warbows, and recruited many of their soldiers from the forests of northern England and Sussex in the early period. As the ''institution'' grew, the Welsh also adopted the yew bow, and became key drafts into English service but were by no means superior to the Englishmen who were bound by law to practice archery. In time, the power of the bow in medieval warfare was illustrated on the fields of Agincourt and Crecy with legendary results. Nonetheless, main suppliers of yew were actually from the continent where the bow was also known, however like the pre-medieval usage it never really caught on until the late era, where it was quickly eclipsed by gunpowder weapons. English mercenary longbowmen and soldiers were known in small units even among the Teutonic Order and Iberia, as well as ironically among the ''Scots Guards'' of the French. English armies however hailed the weapon, especially since it raised the common man to a level playing field against armoured nobles, particulary the hated French! ',
'The word yeoman comes from the Anglo-Saxon ''geoguth'' or ''youth''. It referred originally to the ''second sons'' of noble families who had good backgrounds but were not heirs to estates, and so sought their fortunes in war. In the medieval period, yeomen had an enduring place in the feudal system despite being undermined by the new Norman masters. One reason for this might be due to the fact that they did not hold any real status to begin with to be undermined by the Normans that had reduced the English nobility to sergeants and local chieftains. In time, the yeoman became a class unto themselves, a kind of esquire -from Latin ''scutarius'' in the sense of shield bearer- an unofficial title of respect, having no precise significance, used to denote a high but indeterminate social status. By Tudor times and thereafter the term yeoman referred to trusted royal household troops such as bodyguards.',
'The Zagwe dynasty ruled Ethiopia from approximately 1137 to 1270, when Yekuno Amlak defeated and killed the last Zagwe king in battle. The name of the dynasty is thought to come from the Ge''ez phrase Ze-Agaw, meaning ''of Agaw'' and refer to the Agaw people. Its best-known king was Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, who is given credit for the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela. Around 960, Queen Gudit destroyed the remnants of the Aksumite Empire causing a shift in its temporal power centre that later regrouped more to the south. For 40 years she ruled over those remnants, eventually passing them on to her descendants. According to other Ethiopian traditional accounts, the last of her dynasty was overthrown by Mara Takla Haymanot in 1137. He married a daughter of the last king of Axum, Dil Na''od putting control of Ethiopia in Agaw hands.',

'Although, the sword and buckler is often associated with the fencing methods of the early 1500s and with the common serving man, it was a form of fighting with a much longer tradition. Sword and buckler fighting also became a “combat sport” of sorts, but not before it had already long been a martial system of self-defense and battlefield skill.  What is recognisable about the buckler is that it was foremost a military tool used in war by both soldiers and knights. In the Middle Ages, bucklers were common armaments among both knights and common soldiers – even more so than shields.  A buckler was less cumbersome and more agile than a larger shield and easier to carry about or wear on the hip.  We know that sword and buckler play was a popular pastime in northern Italy, in Germany, and in England. The earliest references to professional combat instructors or masters of defense as they were to become known all have one thing in common. They refer to schools of sword and buckler. Add to this the fact that the earliest known fechtbuch or fight book is dedicated solely to sword and buckler combat, then it becomes apparent that sword and buckler combat is arguably the oldest surviving martial tradition within Western Martial Arts today. The primary use of the buckler in Europe was by infantry. Light infantry, made up of commoners armed with bucklers and swords or falchions lined up behind troops with pole-weapons, were used frequently in armies during the 1100s to 1300s. Early Medieval pictorial sources, from c.650 to c.1100, additionally show bucklers in use by Celtic, Frankish, and Byzantine horsemen. Medievalist Donald Kagay reports of ordinances from 1363 by the Crown of Aragon’s parliament of Monzón which specified the military equipment required for frontier troops on active duty. Light mounted troops were required to have among their weapons a cuyrase (breast plate), a camisol (maile shirt), helmet, lance, and a small round leather shield called a darga de scut. Bucklers are also common in Medieval artwork depicting Middle Eastern warriors, but these small shields are actually for mounted combat and are typically held sideways by two straps as opposed to the center-held buckler with its single handle.  But the sword and buckler was most effective in foot combat such as with the Italian Rotulari (c. 1475) buckler infantry. One historian best explains their development: “It was to combat the new emphasis on field fortifications that a new type of infantry became popular in Italian armies. This was the so-called ‘sword and buckler’ infantry, first experimented with by Braccio. They were lightly armed, agile, and equipped for hand-to-hand offensive fighting. The type had already been developed in Spain in fighting with the Moors, and the establishment of Aragonese in Naples in the 1440s clearly had something to do with their appearance in Italy at this time.”',

'The crossbow began its medieval life as a bulky weapon owing much to its Graeco-Roman predecessors. Naturally, with the increase in use on the battlefield, new technology was applied to its advancement. Among many of the improvements to the handheld crossbow was a variety of spanning methods to retract the heavy bowstring into place. Crossbowmen on foot developed the Stirrup, Pull lever, Push lever and the Windlass to give a quick efficient draw to this powerful weapon. None of these devices were possible to use on horseback however, until the invention of the Rack & Pinion (cranequin) which involved a metal cog, a pin to stop the cog retracting and a pinion to withdraw the string- it was basically a winding crank. With this compact and effective device it was possible to winch a crossbow into loading and use it from horseback. Like mounted archers, it was possible with good technique and practice to shoot from the saddle whilst riding but making a precise shot was difficult. Naturally medieval battlefields rarely needed a mounted sniper however, instead it was the volume of missiles fired into packed groups that was of most use. A mounted archer was much more mobile and far better at harassment and skirmish than an archer on foot. The other advantage of the crossbow was that the loaded bolt could be held in place for long periods, unlike a drawn bow. Therefore the cranequinier could ride into position and fire his shot at the optimal moment, and was thus more likely to fire a precision shot than a mounted archer in fact. However, the slow reload of the crossbow meant that mounted archers could fire more shots and were therefore more effective in their specific role, and by the time the cranequin was invented both the longbow and the use of gunpowder had begun to make all other such equipment largely impotent.',

'The Curonians were known as fierce warriors, excellent sailors and pirates. They were involved in several wars and alliances with Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic Vikings. Grobin was their main center during the Vendel Age. Chapter 46 of Egils Saga describes one Viking expedition by the Vikings Thorolf and Egill Skallagrímsson in Courland. They took part with Estonians in attacking Sweden''s main city Sigtuna in 1187. Curonians established temporary settlements near Riga and in overseas regions including eastern Sweden and the islands of Gotland and Bornholm, similarly Scandinavians began settling in western Baltic lands such as Lithuania and Latvia. The Curonians were an especially religious people, worshipping pagan gods and their sacred animal, the horse. Some of the most important writing sources about the Curonians are the Rimbert''s Vita Ansgarii, the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia, the Livländische Reimchronik, Egils Saga, and Saxo Grammaticus''s Gesta Danorum.',
'A town militia was subdivided into several ''vouden'' or folds. Such a ''voud'' or fold counts about 600 men and was composed of both patricians and craftsmen- those living within the town walls who also owned a strip of land in town, and those who belonged to a particular trade union. The patricians provided a number of men per town district in proportion to the respective number of people living in each of the districts. Each fold had a number of ''coningstavelryen'' or constabularies which was each made up of about 20 serjeants, 6 horses and 2 wagons. Such a unit was commanded by a ''coningstavel'' or constable. The town council payed for the horses and wagons, but the common serjeant would hardly receive a penny. At the battle of Courtrai, the number of infantrymen supplied by the town of Bruges is estimated to have been about 3.000. They were armed almost exclusively with the crossbow. In 1302, Bruges disposes of a contingent of sixteen constabularies, each having around 20 crossbowmen, 10 servants and 2 supply wagons. The town had a force totalling 320 crossbows supported by 160 servants carrying the pavises and ammunitions. The crossbowmen formed the elite of the communal army and a member of the elite Saint-George Guild was paid a wage of 4/- per day, an amount very similar to the daily pay of a squire.',

'The Anatolian Peninsula is known for its traditional Ghazi horse raiders. A way of life was cleaved by the Turkish aristorcary into a consistently effective military unit. Akıncılar means simply "raider". The horse ability of the Anatolian and especially Capadoccian peasants formed the basis of a classic medieval unit which made a significant historical imprint on many campaigns and battles. Their horses were bread for speed not strength, and were often supplied by the riders village having a common bond with their master. The Akıncılar could repeatedly outrun pursuing cavalry and used agility and mobility to rout undiscipline troops, employ hit and run tactics or preform a myriad of special tasks at the whim of a crafty commander both on the battlefield and during the campaign. The commmanders of the forces were very often members of a dynastic caste system, and were bread for the job from childhood. Many of these tribesmen had Turkmen roots, and their skills with the horse and command of horse units were passed down through generations. So reputed were these "bands" that they had a special place in Anatolian and late Ottoman armies, often being rewarded with special post-battle privileges and special rations and compensation. This resulted in many mercenaries and dedicated soldiers in attempting to join their ranks, of which few managed the rigours of entering what were tightly-knit bands with a web of hereditary ties, and many died trying.

'In the context of late medieval siege warfare the term superguns applies to stone-firing bombards with a ball diameter of more than 50 cm. These superguns were either manufactured by forging together longitudinal iron bars, held in place by iron rings, or cast in bronze with techniques generally similar to bellfounding. At the beginning of the development of superguns was the desire to increase the effect of the projectiles. To this end, master gunners first simply used larger powder loads. These, however, exerted larger pressure on the existing cannon and could make it burst, causing the death of the irreplaceable gunner with his crew (and even kings). James II enthusiastically promoted modern artillery, which he used with some success against the Black Douglases. His ambitions to increase Scotland''s standing saw him besiege Roxburgh Castle in 1460, one of the last Scottish castles still held by the English after the Wars of Independence. For this siege, James took a large number of cannons imported from Flanders. On 3 August, he was attempting to fire one of these cannons, known as "the Lion", when it exploded and killed him. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie stated in his history of James''s reign that "as the King stood near a piece of artillery, his thigh bone was dug in two with a piece of misframed gun that brake in shooting, by which he was stricken to the ground and died hastily." In addition, it was observed that, due to their higher velocity, stone balls were shattered by the impact on the walls rather than smashing them. Thus, the mass of the cannon balls and, consequently, of the ordnance too continually increased, finally culminating in giant cannon like the Pumhart von Steyr which fired a 690 kg ball nearly a metre in diameter, loaded with 15 kg of gunpowder! The Dulle Griet is a medieval supergun from Ghent, Belgium. The wrought-iron bombard was constructed in the first half of the 15th century from 32 longitudinal bars enclosed by 61 rings. In 1452, the bombard was employed by the city of Ghent in the siege of Oudenaarde, but fell into the hands of the defenders in their retreat, not surprising that they couldn''t take it with them since it weighed nearly 17 tons. Mons Meg is a medieval bombard which can be classed as a supergun, now located at Edinburgh Castle, Scotland. There are conflicting theories about its origins, but it appears from the accounts of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy that it was made to his order around 1449 and sent as a gift 8 years later to King James II of Scotland, with other artillery supplies. The 20-inch (510 mm) calibre cannon accepted balls that weighed about 400 pounds (180 kg), although it could only be fired 8-10 times a day due to the tremendous heat generated by the powder charge required. The Faule Mette (German for Lazy Mette, alluding to the lack of mobility and slow rate of fire of such super-sized cannon) or Faule Metze was a medieval supergun of the city of Brunswick, Germany. Cast by the gunfounder Henning Bussenschutte on the central market square Kohlmarkt in 1411, it was fitted with a conically tapered muzzle (calibre of 67–80 cm) which allowed the use of projectiles of varying size. Thus, it could fire stone balls weighing between 322 and 423 kg with a gunpowder load ranging from 24 to 33 kg. he Faule Grete (German for Lazy Grete, alluding to the lack of mobility and slow rate of fire of such super-sized cannon) was a medieval supergun of the Teutonic Order. The bronze bombard was cast in 1409 in the cannon foundry of the Marienburg by the gunfounder Heynrich Dumechen. According to the account books of the order, the construction costs amounted to 278.5 Mark, a sum equivalent to ca. 1160 oxen. The Grose Bochse (old German for "Big Gun") was a medieval supergun of the Teutonic Order. It was cast from June to September 1408 in several pieces and was presumably assembled by a screw or plug connection. In terms of size, the cannon even superseded the slightly later finished Faule Grete and may have reached the dimensions of the largest known bombard by caliber, the Pumhart von Steyr.',
'Werner was a Swabian member of the ducal family of Urslingen, and a descendant of the dukes of Spoleto. His name was Italianicised to Guarnieri d''Urslingen, or merely ''the Duke'' Duca Guarnieri. He began his military career in 1338 fighting for Venice against the della Scala family ruling Verona. Afterwards he joined the Compagnia di San Giorgio, financed by the Veronese and led by a member of the Visconti family. After taking part in the Battle of Parabiago he formed his own company in 1342 employed by Pisa against Florence under the Malatesta family. His experience as a soldier paid off, and his company became quickly famed as the Great Company. During their early days they sacked Tuscany, Umbria and Romagna. Werner also supported Ordelaffi against the Papacy, then fought for Bologna against Modena and then switched sides to the Este family and sacked several cities including Correggio. He became feared as the ultimate Condittiero, his motto was ''Enemy of God, Enemy of piety, Enemy of Pity'' which he had inscribed on his breastplate. At one point, Luigi of Taranto hired him to defend Capua, Aversa and the south for 100,000 florins. Typically he fielded about 6,000 men-at-arms and 2,000 crossbowmen of German, Pisan and Catalan backgrounds. He fought in Germany as well as Italy and in 1347 captured Naples for Louis I the Great, king of Hungary and Poland. After numerous victories and conquests his men were struck by the plague, ambushed by the Voivoda of Transylvania, Stephen Laczkfy and defeated. Werner bounced back with an army of 3,000 Hungarian, German and Neapolitan knights and 2,000 Lombard infantry. In 1350 he was hired to capture Bologna for the exiled leader of the city Giacomo Pepoli, he sacked the city, handed it over to Pepoli and then besieged it again for ransom. He returned to Swabia, where he died in 1354 at which point the leadership of the Great Company passed to Fra'' Moriale and the legend lived on.',

'Icelandic records speak of men who often went east and entered royal service in Norway, mentioned particularly in Brennu-Njál''s Saga, and also referred to the Icelandic law code as a man contrasted to ''thrall'' or serf. Lausamenn, meant literally ''loose men'' those without ties to any specific House or clan. Ironically, it was precisely these men that were well-known abroad as emigré Huskarlar. On Iceland however they represented the free men of the small farmsteads which made up Iceland''s communities. While the composite bow may seem an unlikely weapon for a land so remote and so far from its eastern origins, the weapon was known amongst the Vikings as the ''Hunnic bow'' or ''Horn bow''. Whilst of a very simple and reduced design compared to the eastern bows, this small compact weapon was perfect for the peculiar climate of Iceland where wooden bows were sensitive to the damp weather and where tall trees were unavailable to make warbows. Several Nordic sagas refer to the use of hornbows in skirmishes across the open landscape. Konungs skuggsjá (The King''s Mirror), a 13th century Norwegian training text, refers to a hornbogi (horn bow) as being a useful weapon for a mounted warrior, since it is easy to draw while on horseback. Recurve bows are seen in Brennu-Njáls saga, chapter 63, where Gunnar and his brothers Kolskeggr and Hjörtr were ambushed by Starkaðr and a much larger band of men.

'Flatha were traditionally the Gaelic nobility an ancient social group descended from all the royal houses. However, with the arrival of the foriegn authoritys of Normans, Scots and English the old system and its terminology waned in favour of ''barons''. The few ''Ri'' kings left in the higher Middle Ages were naturally surrounded by a mixture of cultural and ethnic nobles. A Boaire was a ''free-holder'', often a subnoble grade, or middle class. While not officially having recognition as a noble grade, and instead being the highest grade of ignoble free-men, they were treated as nobles by numerous foreigners, and many held regional sub-noble titles, such as being a chief of a lesser tribe or clan. As the Cambro-Norman culture took over Ireland, the Bóairi represented a higher echelon of the old heirarchy and in many ways the Irish nobility themselves were indistinguighable from their easterly counterparts, but in the cases of the more pastoral lords they were in all senses ''chiefs''. It was the continued rank of the lesser nobles as landowners which was one of the few continuities in medieval Ireland.',

'Gallowglasses, literally ''foreign warriors'', were fierce men from the Eilean Siar (Western Isles), of mixed Gaelic and Viking descent. After the defeat of the Norwegians at the Battle of Largs, the inhabitants of the contested islands descended into a petty war of succession, with various descendants of the Viking nobles or Gaelic warlords forming clans of followers. When one of these clans was defeated, they were forced to flee their homes, often looking for new work as mercenary soldiers, notably in Ireland. They were protected by a helmet, a mail coat and a breastplate. They carried a great axe or a claymore. The claymore was a relatively popular weapon for the Scots, and despite its Gaelic name ''claimheamh mòr- ''great sword'', the weapon itself was probably introduced by the Vikings. But in the Scottish Early Medieval period it became increasingly useful against both heavy infantry and cavalry, its primary quality being disturbing spear formations. Originally it was a tribal weapon, fielded in small numbers by specialist shock troops, however in time, even noblemen such as William Wallace used the weapon. In the later Medieval period, the longswords and Germanic zweihänder became the weapons that were key elements of pike and musket warfare. After being organised by the Scottish national army, they were formed into Corrughadh or ''battle groups'' of 100 men. They were well-paid and respected men, basically tribal sergeants who would bring with them their own small band of kerns to support them.',

'The Khazars'' tribal structure were divided between Ak-Khazars (''White Khazars'') and Kara-Khazars (''Black Khazars''). The 10th-century Muslim geographer al-Istakhri claimed that the White Khazars were strikingly handsome with reddish hair, white skin and blue eyes while the Black Khazars were swarthy verging on deep black as if they were ''some kind of Indian''.

Generally known as Compendium historiarum, or a concise history of the world, it spans the time from the Creation of the world to the accession of Isaac I Comnenus in 1057. Kedrenos documented a joint attack on the Khazar state in Kerch, ruled by Georgius Tzul, by the Byzantines and Russians in 1016. By at least the year 900 the Khazars were following the Jewish faith and had many of their customs, for instance all the Khazar rulers had Hebrew names such as Aaron, Benjamin and Joseph. In the 950s King Joseph of the Khazar nation is known to have had direct contact with the Caliphate of Cordoba in southern Spain, preserved in the documents known as the the “Khazar Correspondence”. Jewish Khazars were also mentioned in a Georgian chronicle as a group that inhabited Derbent in the late 12th century. Giovanni di Plano Carpini, a 13th century Papal legate to the court of the Mongol Khan Guyuk, gave a list of the nations the Mongols had conquered in his account.

Fadhlun the Kurd has been identified as al-Fadhl ibn Muhammad al-Shaddadi, who ruled Arran and other parts of Azerbaijan in the 1030s.

'The Khazars'' tribal structure were divided between Ak-Khazars (''White Khazars'') and Kara-Khazars (''Black Khazars'').

'Arsiyah, sometimes referred to as al-Arsiyya or As-yah was the name used for a group of Muslim mercenaries in the service of the Khazar Khaganate. Whether the Arsiyah were a single tribe or composed of Muslims from a number of different tribes is unclear. Also unclear is their origin; many historians regard them as deriving from Khwarazm, but some scholars point to the fact that ''As'' is the Turkic term for Alans and believe that the Arsiyah were Alanic in origin. According to Muslim sources, the Arsiyah formed the core of the Khazar army and were extremely influential in Khazar politics, but these assertions may be designed to exaggerate the importance of the Muslim community in Khazaria. The Arsiyah did often act independently of their government. Part of the treaty binding them to Khazar service guaranteed that they would not be used to fight other Muslims. In 913, the Arsiyah ambushed a Viking fleet that had been granted passage to the Caspian Sea by the Khazar government, wiping out thousands of Rus warriors.',

'In the Kievan period, in a category below muzhi [''men''] were the liudi [people]. Their weregild in the Russkaia Pravda was the same as the non-service aristocracy. Precise definitions of this class are hard to come by. They seem to have been moderately well-to-do urban or rural people, with wealth based on industrial enterprises, trade, or land ownership. They had no special legal privileges. The lower classes in Kievan society were made up of diverse rural and urban elements. The weregild for these lower-class freemen was fixed at 5 grivnas. This ''price-bracket'' of freemen (between 5 and 40 grivnas) were in cities, called molodshie liudi (literally, ''junior people''). They were artisans and craftsmen, often organised into guilds and associations. The term is also very well attested in both the Russian Primary Chronicle and Novgorod Chronicles. They seem to be the same as the ''Blacks'' or ''Common People'' who are in no way serfs but who are contrasted with the Boyars as ''chornago'', ''the common people rose against the Boyars...''

With the development of the Russian state in the late medieval period, a large number of deti boyarskie transferred their service to the grand prince. ''Deti boyarskie'' stood above dvoryan, since the latter often came from unfree princely servants from the appanage times. They were eventually members of collateral branches of boyar families, and immigrants from principalities outside of the major capitals, people who had advanced through long service to the sovereign.

'A zadruga refers to a type of rural community historically common among South Slavs. Originally, generally formed of one family or a clan of related families, the zadruga held its property, herds and money in common, with usually the oldest (patriarch) member ruling and making decisions for the family, though at times he would delegate this right at an old age to one of his sons. Because the zadruga was based on a patrilocal system, when a girl married, she left her parents'' zadruga and joined that of her husband. Within the zadruga, all of the family members worked to ensure that the needs of every other member were met. It should be made clear that the zadruga was a socioeconomic entity and only had military functions in the loosest, indirect sense.

The Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus was a primarily French office, due to the sheer number of Frankish volunteers in the crusades this is not surprising. The military hospitals of St.John, Mary (Teutonic) and St. Lazarus were full of wounded soldiers and the desire to fight for the Cross was deeply embedded in the European psyche, those afflicted with handicaps and lethal diseases in the Holy Land naturally reflected over the more spiritual motivations of their final days rather than the probable material drives that brought them there. Although hardly able-bodied men, they were still knights and sergeants and they were in many ways much more true to the cause than their healthier comrades. What they lacked in ability they made up for in sheer willpower, they were still crusaders after all.

'In the 1420s, The Earls of Buchan, Douglas, Murray and Mar had led some 6,000 Scottish Knights and Men-at-Arms to France to help the King of France against the English. They participated at the siege of Orleans alongside Rene d’Anjou and Joan of Arc. In 1424 at the bloody battle of Verneuil large numbers of the Scots contingent were killed including Sir John Stewart, the Earls of Buchan, Douglas, Murray & Mar and Sir William Seton. Sir John de Montgomery, the only remaining commander drew off the remaining Scots in good order in a fighting rearguard action. In 1425 Charles VII of France created an elite bodyguard of Scots. However there were still a great number of Scots gentlemen who could not be accommodated in the Scots guards and this group formed themselves into what amounted to an independent company called ‘Compagnie des gentilhommes Ecossais’ and wore a Fleur de Lys on their left breast to show that they owed allegiance to the King of France. It was formed from five individual companies of roughly 50 men each, including guisarmes and bowmen. This contingent helped Rene d’Anjou to regain the Kingdom of Naples and for this, were granted recognition in the form of a Document by Rene in which Rene used the term ‘Ordre du Lys’. The Order’s badge now became a cross fleury outlined in gold or yellow with a fleur de lys at its centre. In 1445 John de Montgomery was killed and Rene appointed Francisco Sforza, to be the Commander of the remainder of the Compagnie, who at that time were acting as mercenaries for Sforza, now Duke of Milan with money provided by Cosimo de Medici. In 1444 members of the Order and the Company, had fought in what today we call Bosnia-Herzegovina, but which at that time was part of the Serbian Byzantine Empire and which was in the forefront of the fight against Islam. The Order succeeded in returning George Brankovich to the throne of Serbia and this event is still marked today by the Fleur-de-Lys Monument (Called the Fleur-de-Lys Obelisk) at Blatsha. The knights followed Janos Hunyadi, Regent of Hungary (Rene was Titular King of Hungary), against Sultan Murad II where they were massacred in the 2nd Battle of Kosovo.',

'As a result of the confrontation with the technically superior methods of warfare of the Teutonic Order, a reorganisation of Lithuanian military tactics became necessary. This development should be dated to the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth centuries. It included, among other things, the development of a cavalry with large horses and thus necessarily also the establishment of stud farms. Scattered reports of these are found in the chronicles of the Order. We know that around 1367 the Lithuanian prince Kestutis had a stud farm with fifty mares in Kaunas and there are also reports of a stud farm at another location. As many as 400 horses were kept in one stud farm in Zemaitija around 1379. It is to be assumed that the Lithuanians obtained breeding material for their large horses primarily during war and plundering campaigns into Prussia, as they did in 1376 at Insterburg when they attacked one of the Order''s stud farms which had fifty mares, two stallions and sixty warhorses and foals, and seized these. In the course of the fourteenth century the ''non-Christians'' became increasingly powerful opponents which the Teutonic Order had to take seriously, as the knightly culture of western and central Europe was no longer unknown to them. It is not without reason that in an anonymous address composed in 1415 for the Council of Constance (presumably, however, not delivered) the Order complained that ''the non-believers of whom one is at present speaking now appear powerful everywhere, with shining armour, with warhorses [geroesse] and other military equipment''. The author of this document knew what he was talking about, as five years previously the Order had suffered a devastating defeat at Tannenberg (in Polish known as Grunwald and in Lithuanian as Zalgiris) on 15 July 1410, by a joint Polish and Lithuanian army.',

'Leičiai (sg.: leitis) were a distinct social group in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They disappear altogether by the time of the Wallach Reform. The ethnonymic meaning of leičiai, e.g. ''Lithuanians'', is known from several sources. The word leitis, leičiai (< *leitiai) derives from the form *leitā, a synonym of *lietuvā, *leitavā, which had the meaning of armed retinue, bodyguard, attendant soldiery, troop, which is shown by numerous writings, for example Russian sources: krestil knjazja Litovskago imenem Evnutija i ego družinu Litvu – ''baptized the duke of Lithuania Jaunutis and his retinue Lithuania''; I pšišed posol Totui i vydal Korjadą i ego družinu Litvu knjazju velikomu Semenu Ivanovičiu – ''and came an envoy Totui and handed Karijotas and his retinue Lithuania over for Grand Duke Semyon Ivanovich''. According to S Karaliūnas, leičiai were also stablemen, caring for warhorses more as grooms than squires, which were an important martial property. As a social group leičiai were mentioned in the sources of the 15th and the first half of the 16th century. They were the possession of a monarch, that is, subordinates to a state, not personally to nobles. The first such mention of them is known from 1407, when Vytautas granted an estate, among which staff leytey are mentioned, for Manvydas, then an elder of Vilnius. The monarchs Alexander Jagiellon and Sigismund I the Old used to transfer their estates to nobles for a temporary administration, receiving cash, which was needed for a war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The documentation of such contracts is the major source of leičiai'' mentions. They were mentioned among service staff in various estates. Leičiai were warlike servants of a ruler, the staff enforcing his authority. Their duties were likely related with warfare, among which possibly were growing of riding horses, providing roadmen, protection of the frontiers. One leitis from Eišiškės volost, in a litigation against a minor land owner over his patrimonial plot in 1514, said that he was an eternal leitis (лейти звечный). In Western Europe we might compare them to local marshalls, sherriffs, sergeants or royal guard grooms.',

Mangudai ranks were made wholly of volunteers - in a society with a fierce warrior ethic, the chance to prove your bravery was highly coveted.

But essentially, the Mangudai were suicide troops.  When an enemy force was located, the Mangudai armed only with bows, arrows and light shield and armor, would ride ahead of the main force and attack the foe recklessly.

'Although the longbow is widely considered the weapon of the Engish, the evidence for the use of the longbow in a more advanced form- on horseback is not only found amongst the English. King Charles VII of France had a bodyguard of mounted men armed with brigantine or gambeson, and armed with longbows. The Dukes of Burgundy also used them in significant numbers, as they were wont to do on foot. Froissart, a first hand witness to the Hundred Years War documents them in all three forces, but specifically an illumination depicts them riding at full gallop in English ranks towards the French lines. These mounted longbowmen wear full plate harness as was usually seen worn by knights and greater men-at-arms, when in contrast longbowmen on foot were typically rank and file wearing only gambeson. It seems reasonable to assume therefore that the requirements of advanced horsemanship to fire a heavy warbow and ride would require men of great skill and lifelong military training. Such men would also need the funds for such upbringing, not least the horse- and it seems rather straightforward therefore that such class of men would also have funds to clad themselves in plate armour. Such exquisite skills would merit protection in good armour. They seem to have only appeared in the local conflicts of France however, and may have been of continental rather than English extraction, possibly Burdundians in English service. Nonetheless they were not fielded in large hosts and were likely a very rare elite, which seems reasonable considering the royal French bodyguard was at least in part formed of such men. The French called the longbow l''Arc Droit, and the name archiers itself was applied in an official sense to the Royal Bodyguard who in fact carried the name for centuries afterwards as the elite of musketeers. At least 3000 mounted archers rode with Edward at Crécy in 1346, around a fifth of his force, this group were pitted against the elite Genoese crossbowmen of the French of whom there were perhaps as many as 6000. Although it is unlikely that all 3000 archers fought on horseback (they were probably merely mobile infantry) it seems reasonable that some of them would have also fought on horseback as well.',
'A brilliant sample of Russian guns of the 15th century is the bronze pishchal cast by Russian master Jacob in 1491. It is the only dated monument of Russian bronze cannon founding of the 15th century which has survived to the present day. Since the late Muscovian medieval era the word pushkar (i. e. gunner) may be found in Russian chronicles. It shows that people specially trained for firing guns appeared in the Russian army at that time. According to Russian chronicles, the explosive characteristics of powder had already been known in Rus by the time of the Kulikovskaia battle. The earliest mention of combat using Russian artillery dates from 1382. Muscovites used tiufiaks and ''great guns'' during the defence of Moscow from troops of Khan Tokhtamysh in September of that year. Three general types of arms had been used in the Russian artillery by the early 15th century. These are cannons, intended for plunging fire, pishchals for flat trajectory firing with balls and tiufiaks for short­range firing with drob. Considerable changes took place in artillery of the 15th century. These connect first of all with new technology of making guns and powder. In the middle of the century iron forging was replaced with casting guns from bronze, an alloy of copper and tin which made the production process much easier and quicker. In addition sighting systems appeared in the form of front and back sights that were intended for visual homing guidance of the gun on a target. ',

'Mawali or mawālá (Arabic: موالي‎) is a term in Classical Arabic used to address non-Arab Muslims. The term gained prominence in the centuries following the early Arab Muslim conquests in the 7th century, as many non-Arabs such as Persians, Egyptians, and Turks converted to Islam. These converts were treated as second class citizens by the ruling Arab elite - they continued to pay the tax required of nonbelievers and were excluded from government and the military until the end of the Umayyad Caliphate. Therefore, many of them were drawn to the anti-Ummayyad activities of the Kaysanites Shia. Under the Abbasid rulers of the 9th century, the mawālī comprised an important part of the army. The fragmentation of the Abbasid around 900 took place with the mawālī rise to power, the Saffarid Dynasty and Ghaznavids in Greater Iran, and the Qarmatians in the Arabian Peninsula. Together, the rise to power of these ethnic groups restricted the power of the Abbasid caliph into Baghdad.',

'The word naphtha came from Latin and Greek where it derived from Persian. In Ancient Greek, it was used to refer to any sort of petroleum or pitch. It appears in Arabic as "nafţ" (نَفْط) ("petroleum"), and in Hebrew as "neft" (נֵפְט). Arabs and Persians have used and distilled petroleum for tar and fuel from ancient times, as attested in local Greek and Roman histories of the region. Greek fire was an incendiary weapon used by the Byzantine Empire who typically used it in naval battles to great effect as it could continue burning while floating on water. It provided a technological advantage, and was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of Constantinople from two Arab sieges, thus securing the Empire''s survival. The composition of Greek fire remains a matter of speculation and debate, with proposals including combinations of pine resin, naphtha, quicklime, sulphur, or niter. Byzantine use of incendiary mixtures was distinguished by the use of pressurized siphons to project the liquid onto the enemy. Greek fire continued to be mentioned during the 12th century, and Anna Komnene gives a vivid description of its use in a naval battle against the Pisans in 1099. However, although the use of hastily improvised fireships is mentioned during the 1203 siege of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, no report confirms the use of the actual Greek fire. This might be because of the general disarmament of the Empire in the twenty years leading up to the sacking, or because the Byzantines had lost access to the areas where the primary ingredients were to be found, or even perhaps because the secret had been lost over time. The information available on Greek fire is exclusively indirect, based on references in the Byzantine military manuals and a number of secondary historical sources such as Anna Komnene and Western European chroniclers, which are often inaccurate. In her Alexiad, Anna Komnene provides a description of an incendiary weapon, which was used by the Byzantine garrison of Dyrrhachium in 1108 against the Normans. It is often regarded as an at least partial "recipe" for Greek fire: "This fire is made by the following arts. From the pine and the certain such evergreen trees inflammable resin is collected. This is rubbed with sulphur and put into tubes of reed, and is blown by men using it with violent and continuous breath. Then in this manner it meets the fire on the tip and catches light and falls like a fiery whirlwind on the faces of the enemies." At the same time, the reports by Western chroniclers of the famed ignis graecus are largely unreliable, since they apply the name to any and all sorts of incendiary substances. A 12th-century treatise prepared by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi for Saladin records an Arab version of Greek fire, called naft, which also had a petroleum base, with sulphur and various resins added. The Arabs, however, soon learned the exact composition of the combustible mixture and used it themselves in Asia, where they transmitted it to the Chinese. Indeed, by the year 850 even crew members of Arab trading vessels in the Indian Ocean would use it to protect their ships against pirates, and during the reign of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil each corps of archers in the infantry had a special division of naphtha-throwers called naffatun, who wore fireproof suits, perhaps of asbestos, and hurled "grenades" at the enemy by hand or with catapults. Some of the "grenades" were astoundingly similar in size and shape to those used in modern times: round iron - or clay - jars which contained the flammable mixture and exploded shortly after the lids were opened. What these advances in the military sciences tell us is that by the middle of the ninth century, Muslim forces were using large quantities of flammable petroleum products - at times more flammable than the heavy crude oils collected in Iraq and Iran. This was the result of an amazing technological breakthrough: distillation.',
'The Navarrese Company was formed by Carlos el Malo of Navarra to fight against the French king during the war in Normandy and Auvergne in 1365. After the peace of 1366 the Company was organized by Luis de Beaumont-le-Roger, brother of the king Carlos, who was married with Joanna of Durazzo. Because of this marriage, Luis had the title ''Duke of Durazzo'', but this town was in power of the Albanian troops of Charles Thopia. In order to regain the power in his Dukedom, Luis prepared an expedition to reconquer Durazzo, with his Company of Navarrese and Gascon soldiers. In 1375 they left Tortosa, in Aragón, and in 1376 they restablished the Regnum Albaniae conquering Durazzo again. Luis died this year, and the Company passed to the command of Juan de Urtubia. In 1378 they entered Morea, and destroyed the Catalan Company in Greece.',
'The word burghers is cognate in a number of Germanic language, such as the Nordic ''borgare'' and French ''bourgeoise.'' The word borg, bourg or English placenames ''bury'' and ''burgh'' all mean a walled fortified town. The term burgher therefore came to mean the civilised middle class that were contrasted to the rural peasants typically portrayed as uncultured and backward- an idea that remains even today. Burghers were naturally capable of bearing arms as much as any man. Most burghers were well-off freemen that would carry a sword and dagger even walking down the street. In times of war they would form ''trained bands'' of garrisons and wall-defenders.',
'During the Ottoman period Turkic nomads were known by the names of Türkmen and Yörük or Yürük (Türkic ''Nomad'', other phonetic variations include Iirk, Iyierk, Hiirk, Hirkan, Hircanae, Hyrkan, Hyrcanae, the last four known from the Greek annals). These names were generally used to describe their nomadic way of life, rather than their ethnic origin. However, these terms were often used interchangeably by foreigners. At the same time, various other exoethnonym words were used for these nomads, such as ''Konar-göçer'', ''Göçebe'', ''Göçer-yörük'', ''Göçerler'', and ''Göçer-evliler''. The most common one among these was ''Konar-göçer'' - nomadic Turcoman Turks. All of these words are found in Ottoman archival documents and carry only the meaning of ''nomad''. There are tribes in the Balkans and Turkey today that still lead nomadic lives as shepherds, and they too carry the name Yörük.',

'The Bagli Party or Norwegian: Baglerne, was a faction or party during the Norwegian Civil Wars. The Bagler faction was made up principally of the Norwegian aristocracy, clergy and merchants. It was formed in Skåne, then part of Denmark, in 1196 principally by Bishop Nicholas Arnesson of Oslo and Archbishop Erik Ivarsson of Nidaros around the pretender Inge Magnusson (nicknamed the Baglar-King) to depose King Sverre Sigurdsson. It contested with the Birkebeiners, essentially a faction of peasants, led by the pretender King Sverre, for control in a Norwegian civil war during the late 12th century. Sverris Saga provided Sverre a royal lineage as putative bastard son of the late king Sigurd II of Norway, which in the Norway of the time provided him a claim to the throne. Bagler comes from the word bagall, from Church-Latin''s baculum, referring to a Bishop''s Crosier. It was mainly the Church establishment, particularly the Archbishopric of Lund which was the main ecclesiarchal political centre for the North, that interfered in the political crises.',
'Sigvatr Þórðarson (also known as Sigvat the Skald), a court poet to two kings of Norway, Olaf II of Norway (saint Olaf) and Magnus the Good (and also to two kings of Denmark), called the retainers of Olaf II of Norway heiðþegar, meaning ''gift- (or pay-) receivers''. More precisely, Snorri Sturluson explained that ''heið-money is the name of the wages or gift which chieftains give''. Thus, Sigvat probably referred to an institution similar to the Danish heimþegar or to the housecarls of Canute the Great: free men in the service of a king or lord, who gave them gifts as payment of said service. From a military perspective they were fairly effective in the early era as a form of home guard or royal men-at-arms, but as with all Norwegian military developments they failed to change with the times and became quickly outdated and irrelevant to pre-Renaissance warfare.',
'A faction of political dissidents that rose to power during the Norwegian Civil War between 1130 and 1240. They were so ''rural'' that they used wooden armour, hence the name ''birch legs''. Although originally a pejorative term, the birkebeiner adopted the name for themselves and continued using it even after they came to power at court in 1184. They were based in Trondhjem and were made up of lawndowners that had been dispossesed, marginalised or disinherited by the kings based around Viken and Bergen, in an attempt to threaten and undermine the power of the county of Trondhjem. Progressing from mere raiders and rebels they quickly acquired support from princes who had a claim to the crown, such as Erling Skakke and Sverre Sigurdsson who in fact himself became king in time. Under such leadership they developed into a more hardened and serious body of fighting men, gaining recruits from as far afield as England.',

'The ʿayyārān have often been confused with the ḡāzīs and fetyān. This is incorrect but explicable. The ḡāzīs, being volunteers for holy war, were only important in frontier regions, at first mainly in Central Asia where they faced the pagan Turks. Although they were recruited from town-dwellers and concentrated in towns, they had no links with the urban social organisations. Conversely the ʿayyārān had nothing to do with holy war. In the frontier regions, however, the two elements were obviously bound to become more or less intermixed, whereas in the towns on the Iranian plateau no such process occurred. There can be little doubt as to their pre-Islamic origin, not only because in later times they were said to have certain distinctively Iranian customs, but above all because in the Islamic period up to the Mongol invasion they were only to be found in territories which had once belonged to the Sassanian Empire. Ayyarun fought for Islam in Asia, though most of the writing about them centres on their Baghdad activities of the 10th to the 12th centuries. Baghdad was ruled by the Buyids (945–1055), and was a very lawless city, caused by fighting between Sunnis and Shi''ites. They did many terrible things such as extorting taxes on roads and markets, burning wealthy quarters and markets, and looting the homes of the rich by night. For several years (1028–33), Al-Burjumi and Ibn al-Mawsili, leaders of the ''ayyarun, ruled the city due to governmental instability. The ''ayyarun have been commonly called thieves and robbers, though these activities are highlighted during times of weak government and civil war, when their role as a military force most likely made them fight on multiple sides, angering many. During times of more stable government, their unlawful activities decreased, and when the Seljuqs ruled in the 12th century, their activities almost ceased. The ''ayyarun also made war against much of society in reaction to social injustices. Outside of Baghdad, the ''ayyarun were closely allied with the middle class, and helped maintain the current order. The Saffarids (861-1003) of eastern Iran were in fact an ''ayyarun dynasty. They are thought by some historians to have contributed to the weakening of Baghdad, clearing the way for the horrific destruction of the city by the Mongols. The term kāka and its cognate kākagi are common words in Afghan Persian (or Dari) and are roughly equivalent to the well-known Persian words, ʿayyār (q.v.) and ʿayyāri, and javānmard and javānmardi. The word kāka is not to be confused with kākā, though the two likely have the same root. In Afghan Persian kākā means “paternal uncle” but is also used as an honorific, reflecting the idea of “sir.” Similarly, terms such as bibi kuku, an honorific for a woman of respect, or lālā ku, an honorific for a respected master, reflect the notion of someone who is considered to be of superior status than others. Although the word ʿayyār means a vagabond or vigilante, the actual social group were characterized by the ideals of piety, courage, generosity, and loyalty.',

'It is calculated that around the year 1400 there were 13,887 horses in the castles, on the breeding farms and on the estates of the Teutonic Order in Prussia, of which only 7,200 belonged to the breed of large military horse. In addition there were the war- and saddle-horses of the brethren of the Order, which have been estimated to have been 2,250 in number. Thus one can assume that the Order was in possession of around 16,000 horses at this time. The large horses were bred not only by the Teutonic Order, but also in the four bishoprics and on the estates of the German and Danish nobles who were under an obligation to perform military service. Those who possessed more than 40 hides of land (1,680 acres) served with heavy armour on a covered horse (dextrarius opertus or textus) which had to be a stallion and with at least two further horsemen as escorts (Rossdienst). Those with 10 to 40 hides had to perform one or more services with ''plate'' or other light weapons (Platendienst).  Plates were made in the form of a ''poncho'' consisting of rows of vertically or horizontally arranged iron plates riveted to leather or thick cloth. The horse was sterilized or castrated (a spado). With the increasing importance of the crossbow as a long-range weapon, armour became heavier and the plate service developed into service on a war-horse which was three to four times as expensive as a Sweik. Rossdienst and Platendienst were clearly lesser landowners and direct entourage of the larger landowners, since the latter equate to barons the former we can relate to sergeants -especially in regard to their feudal duties, equipment and land ownership. Generally, Teutonic military strategy had developed a reliance on short sharp shocks and raids (Stossreisen, Ruckreisen), these presented a constant threat to the natives and allowed a good source of income. Campaigns had to be planned so that as far as possible the army was self-supporting in enemy territory. It is not surprising, therefore, that they were carried out only in summer when fodder was available in the meadows and there was grain in the fields, or in autumn, when enemy stores could be plundered. This was the case in 1409, 1410, 1414, 1422 and 1431 as well as during the Thirteen Years'' War of 1454-66.  That the infantrymen still played no important role in the conduct of the war (except in the case of sieges) was not only a consequence of the superiority of the cavalry, but also because, in contrast with the horsemen, they could carry only limited provisions with them. Mounted troops were quicker, more mobile and could stand their ground longer in the field. ',
'During the conquest of Prussia, the Knights became familiar with a small horse indigenous to that region, the so-called Sweik (Schweike). This designation probably derives from a Baltic word meaning ''healthy'' or ''strong''. These animals had a stocky, muscular build and generally measured at the withers not much more than ten hands. In a letter of 1427 the Teutonic Order grand marshal called them ''little shaggy horses'' (''cleyne gerugete pherde''). The Sweiks were swift, tenacious and hardy. They served the native Prussians and other peoples of the Baltic as saddle- and workhorses as well as war-horses. In the last case, however, it was only possible for the rider to be lightly armed with ''the native Prussian weapons'' of spear, shield (scutum Prutenicum), mail/lamellar armour (Brünne) and the Prussian helmet (a specific variety of the conical helmet) and this is to be contrasted with the western style cavalry using heavy armour, even armoured barding for the horses. Although the Sweiks, because of their limited size, were not used by the Christian conquerors as cavalry horses for themselves, they were bred systematically by the Order. For the Knights'' courier service the so-called Postal-Sweiks (Briesweiken) were indispensable. However, they were not bred by the Order itself, but purchased from native Prussians which indicates they had a certain local or elite nature. When, after a hard struggle, the Prussians had been defeated by the Teutonic Order in the thirteenth century, the native nobles had to perform military service for the Knights against the Lithuanians and later also against the Poles, as light auxiliary troops (Equites Pruteni -''Prussian Knights'').  Like the Turcopoles in the Holy Land, they fought with their native weapons, with which they were familiar, ''according to the custom of the country'', and thus we can assume that the Sweiks were employed as war-horses. The basis of such native Prussian service was the possession of a small farm, often no more than one or two hides of land, as the expense of horse and equipment was not very great. Around 1400, a good German warhorse cost 12 to 15 marks and a very good one 15 to 18 marks, whereas a Sweik could be had for 3 to 6 marks. Much greater sums were paid for excellent chargers - even sums as high as 70 marks. This corroborates the information we have from elsewhere in Europe, but the Sweik was a truly cost-effective rarity.',

'Nobles of the Ghana and Malian Empires. By the tenth century, Ghâna was an immensely rich and prosperous empire, stretching across Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania. The ruler was acclaimed as the ''richest king in the world because of his gold'' by Arab traveler Ibn Hawqal on his visit to the capital city of Kumbi Saleh in 950 AD. In the eleventh century, the kingdom began to weaken and decline. There were numerous reasons as to why. The King lost his trading monopoly, a devastating drought damaged the cattle and cultivation industries, the clans were fractured, the vassal states were rebelling, and, according to Arab tradition, it is said that Almoravid Muslims came from the North and invaded Ghâna. Other interpretations are that the Almoravid authority was gradual and did not involve any form of military takeover. In any event, following their subsequent withdrawal, new gold fields were mined further south and new trade routes were opening further east. Just as it appeared that Ghâna would reemerge, it became the target of attacks by the Susu (another Mandé people) and their leader Sumanguru. From this conflict in 1235 came the Malinké people under a new dynamic ruler, Sundiata Kéita.

'Longbows were known in the north since Viking times, however the weapon never really had the same effect it did in English armies. Bows were made from yew, ash, or elm. Typically, they were 1.6 to 2m (60 to 80 in) long. A complete bow found at Hedeby made of yew was 192cm long. In fact, Scandinavia was one of the main exporters of wood for English longbows. The Vikings and early English called it the ''warbow'', possibly because smaller hunting bows didn''t have the punch to pierce armour. Grágás, the medieval Icelandic law book, requires that the court empowered to confiscate an outlaw''s property be held within bowshot of the outlaw''s home, Grágás defines the bowshot to be two hundred faðmar (about 480m). The so-called Hunnic Bow (Húnbogi) was also known in the north, probably through contact with the Rus in the east, or possibly through actual historical contact with the Huns. It was made of horn and quite compact but it was only a very basic inspiration from the composite bow, and used mainly by nobles on horseback. Again however, the longbow seems to have been the standard for warfare: After Einarr Þambarskelfir''s bow was broken at the Battle at Svölðr in 1000AD, the king threw him his own bow, telling Einar to continue shooting.

'Guests'' were guests at the King''s Table, they were not part of the Hird or personal retinue as such but were men attached to the court and the hangers-on. They were in the service of the Crown indirectly acting as yeomen and servants. For this reason they were occassionally invited to sit and dine with the courtiers and take part in courtly life. In many ways, they were a form of sergeant or squire, typically performing tasks such as escorts, police, bailiffs or heralds.',
'A dreng was a servant, but also came to refer to a class of freemen, those that did not inherit, -younger sons basically. It was typical throughout the Viking Age and early Middle Ages that these men would wander far afield and seek service as a standing army, they were equipped by their masters and would wear their heraldrics. Many of them were the type known amongst the Byzantines as the dispossessed and desparate cutthroats, they would fight and risk death if not as loyal servants then as ambitious men keen on gaining rank and spoils. As standard troops they would be typically dressed in gambeson, some mail with upgrades, a spear and shield, helmet and shortsword. ',
'An account of the 15th century siege of Roxburgh mentions Scottish Islesmen fighting ''in the old Highland manner'' with ''axe, bow and haubergeon''. They were also referred to in more classical texts with the Latin or rather Greek gloss of ''Psiloi'' which meant literally “bare, stripped” (referring to skirmishers) and recalls the early medieval reports of Gaelic troops fighting ''naked''. Most historians take ''naked'' to mean a military sense- of being unarmoured. Whilst it is true that going barefoot was common practice even for fairly wealthy Gaels, the use of gambeson and mail was actually quite widespread even from the 1100s, a far cry from blue-painted men in tartans. In fact, the Highlanders were very much authorityd by their Norse forebears, and it is possible that this is where the use of the warbow originates. However, their clothing -like most Gaels even those in Ireland- was the ubiquitous ''leine'', a saffron or horse-urine stained (in poorer cases) tunic which fastened at the hip with a belt, where a dagger or traditional ''dirk'' would be carried.',
'Military service was required from freeholders, just as in the feudal systems of other nations. As Scotland became more structured and centralised, the organisation of social classes into warfaring units became clearer.

'The term dates from at least 1000 AD and derives from Old English roots expressing the idea of a ''shield-troop''. Some researchers have also posited this etymological relation may show the schiltron is directly descended from the Anglo-Saxon shield wall, and still others give evidence ''schiltron'' is a name derived from a Viking circular formation (generally no less than a thousand fighters) in extremely close formation, intended to present an enemy''s cavalry charge with an ''infinite'' obstacle (that is, a perimeter horses refuse to breach). Matters are confused by the fact that the term in Middle English could clearly refer to a body of soldiers without reference to formation, including cavalry and archers. The first mention of the schiltron as a specific formation of spearmen appears to be at the Battle of Falkirk in 1297. There is, however, no reason to believe this is the first time such a formation was used and, indeed, may have had a long previous history in Scotland, as the Picts used to employ spears in block formation as the backbone of their armies. There are two recorded Scottish instances of circular schiltrons: William Wallace''s army at Falkirk (1298), and Thomas Randolph''s forces on the first day of Bannockburn (1314). The circular formation is essentially static. At Falkirk, the formation was fortified by driving stakes into the ground before the men, with ropes between. Charles Oman describes the formation thus: ''The front ranks knelt with their spear butts fixed in the earth; the rear ranks leveled their lances over their comrades heads;the thick-set grove of twelve foot spears was far too dense for the cavalry to penetrate.'' There are numerous accounts of rectilinear schiltrons — they were employed at the battles of Glen Trool (1307), Bannockburn (the main battle), Myton (1319), Dupplin Muir (1332), Culblean (1335), Halidon Hill (1333), Neville''s Cross (1346) and Otterburn (1388). Unlike the circular schiltron, the rectilinear formation was capable of both defensive and offensive action. The offensive use of the schiltron is a tactical development credited to Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn. He had drilled his troops in the offensive use of the pike (requiring great discipline) and he was able to fight the English forces on flat, firm ground suitable for their large force of cavalry. Bruce''s new tactic was a response to a crushing defeat for the Scots at Falkirk when the first recorded use of the schiltron by a Scottish army failed in the face of a combination of English archers and cavalry. Detailed descriptions of the formation are rare but those given by English chroniclers of Bannockburn demonstrate the essential features: ''They had axes at their sides and lances in their hands.They advanced like a thick-set hedge and such a phalanx could not easily be broken.'' ''They were all on foot; picked men they were, enthusiastic, armed with keen axes, and other weapons, and with their shields closely locked in front of them, they formed an impenetrable phalanx ...'' The term schiltron is also used by Barbour to describe English infantry at Bannockburn. It is also used by the author of the Lanercost Chronicle to describe the English spearmen at the Battle of Boroughbridge (1322). In both cases, a rectalinear formation is being described, though that at Boroughbridge is curved, with its flanks bent back. Schiltron-like formations were also used by the Welsh troops at the battles of Orewin Bridge (1282) and Maes Moydog (1295), although this tactic was generally unsuccessful for the Welsh, arguably due to the lack of superior drill and training required to create an effective formation. Working as a cohesive formation was not widespread military doctrine until the late Middle Ages, and the innovation of the Scots was not the weapon itself but their approach to its use.',
'These men were noted among the Anglo-Irish contingents of nobles such as the Butlers in the 1400s. Along with Gallowglass and Kerns they formed a third class- the more conventionally armed ''gentlemen'' retinues recruited from the relations of the nobles themselves. It is notable that despite having distinct Norman heritage, these upper-class warriors still had a Gaelic soubriquet, like their more provincial compatriots. This infers that they were perhaps part of an older tradition within the clan system. The English and Scots speakers referred to them as ''Tacksmen'' for, being related by birth to the Chief, these men controlled areas or ''tacks'' within the greater clan lands. Rents were collected in various forms and rents from the daoine uaisle which were in turn paid to the Chief, Laird or Lord. Later they were given a more stylised name as ''cadets'' of the noble houses.',
'Clan chiefs would usually only fight leading their clans. But with the emergence of national army organisation and the regulating of levies, militias and feudal service, especially under Norman rule- the crown required a system of military recruitment based on social classes, land ownership, and local authority. In this way, local lords could be called up from an entire district in a similar fashion to the English draft of the ''hundred'' where a champion from each hundred people (usually the village ''headman'') would be equipped by his neighbourhood. In this way the chiefs formed a band of good, solid soldiers. The only drawback to this system was that it totally overlooked clan politics and rivalries, the Norman lords- ignorant of such complexities, failed to realise that this could undermine discipline and organisation in such a competitive assembly of warriors.',

'As the Scottish crown became more centralised in its power and had greater authority over its dominions, a sense of nation was clearer to its citizens.

'The Ismailis are a branch of Shia Islam, in the Middle Ages they were stigmatised by Sunni and Christian alike often as Malahide (or mulhidun) by their enemies -meaning heretic or deviant. Much less frequently, the Ismailis of Syria were called by another abusive term, as Hashishiyya, ie, users of hashish. A branch of these Malahide heretics formed a brotherhood that would evolve into the Hashashin assassin league. Surrounded by the Abbasids and other hostile powers, and low in numbers, Hassan-Al-Sabbah derived a way to attack the Ismāʿīlī''s enemies with minimal losses. Using the method of assassination (the English word is derived from Hashishiyya), he ordered the murders of Sunni scholars and politicians whom he felt threatened the Ismāʿīlīs. Knives and daggers were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed onto the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message that they were marked for death. When an assassination was actually carried out, the Hashasheen would not be allowed to run away, but rather to strike further fear into the enemy, they would stand near the victim without showing any emotion, and departed only when the body was discovered. This further increased the ruthless reputation of the Hashasheen throughout Sunni-controlled lands. Hashishiyya was an Arabic term to refer to a specific order of Nizari Ismailis, particularly those of Persia that existed from around 1092 to 1265. Posing a strong military threat to Sunni Saljuq authority within the Persian territories, the Nizari Ismailis captured and inhabited many mountain fortresses under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah, the founder of the assassin league. Surrounding these strongholds and so-called hide-outs were a steadfast militia culled from the Ismaili community which was co-dependent with the local order. Seeking refuge in the Persian mountains, particularly Hyrcania, these soldiers had much in common with their neighbours the similarly despised but also highly feared pagan Dailamites.',

'The quarterstaff is an ancient peasants'' weapon with its own techniques and its own martial art that is still practiced today. The quarterstaff was the stock weapon of England amongst travellers, pilgrims and paupers generally - every man could wield a quarterstaff just as he knew how to wrestle or box, regardless of his class or social status. The quarterstaff was a cheap and effective weapon, mainly in self-defence, it could easily stop a blow from a sword although against axes and spears it was vulnerable. The various stances and techniques associated with the quarterstaff still carry the names of traditional Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Old English saints such as St.Hilda -many of whom were were based on pagan cults, so old and engrained on the national pysche as they are. More recently and more specific however was the cult of St.George, who became popular in England after English ships sailed under the flag of Genoan escorts through the Mediterranean to the Holy Land on the First Crusade, from which time he was heralded as the patron of England and war. Since it was the standard accessory of travellers, it became the veritable symbol of English pilgrims and those who would protect wayfarers from bandits. For this reason it was very common among rural militias. The word ''ward'' comes from the Old English word for ''to keep guard'' or to ''take care of.'' Henry Thomas Riley writing in the 1300s in his ''roll of the wards in policing'' concerning the militias in London notes that the Wards met at regular councils: ''It is called a wardmoot on the grounds that it is an assembly by summons of the whole populace of one ward, there being present its headman, the alderman or his lieutenant, for the purpose of correcting faults, or removing nuisances, and for furthering the benefit of that ward. What we call a ''wardmoot'' was anciently called a ''folkmoot'' among the Saxons. The aldermen have been accustomed to hold their wardmoots at least once, or twice, or many times a year, by virtue of a warrant sent to them by the mayor then in office. Through which it has been the practice to enquire into the degree of peace and tranquillity within each ward, and for the alderman to correct faults presented.'' The quarterstaff weapon was in the hands of an Englishman a weapon feared by foreigners well into the late 1600s. It could easily handle an armoured opponent on foot and since it had no blade it was light and perfectly balanced making it a very quick weapon. An English crime report from 1527 states: ''John Strynger late of Babworth, laborour, assaulted Henry Pereson of Babworth with a staff worth 1d. Which he held in both hands, striking him on top of the head so that his brains flowed out and giving him a wound 1 inch deep, 2 inches wide and 3 inches long of which he immediately died.'' It was exceptional at  fighting numerous opponents simultaneously, allegedly up to 6 men at a time. It''s only weakness was against receiving cavalry charge due to its lack of blade or point, nonetheless in melée it could easily unhorse a rider or break the legs of a steed as easily as a bladed weapon.',

For subduing civil discords they may carry only defensive weapons, provided they have the permission of the diocesan. The rule of the order was based on that of the Augustinians, but by a precedent set by the Order of Santiago and the Militia of Jesus Christ, members could marry and did not live in communal poverty. Their chief task appears to have been the pacification of the Lombard cities, racked by factional strife. In this they were largely unsuccessful, due in no small part to their political allegiance to the Church. The order gained a reputation for carelessness with respect to their vows and were labelled the fratres gaudentes (Latin) or frati (cavalieri) gaudenti (Italian): jovial/joyous/jubliant brothers/brethren/friars.

'Futuwwa (Arabic: فتوة, ''young-manliness'' or ''piety'') is a Sufi term that has some similarities to piety and virtue. It was also a name of ethical urban organisations or ''guilds'' in medieval Muslim realms that emphasised honesty, peacefulness, gentleness, generosity, avoidance of complaint and hospitality in life. According to Ibn Battuta, a member was called fata (youth, pl. fityan) and group leaders were called akhi. Warriors of the Faith were warbands or warrior guilds. Some were just glorified bands of brigands. In 12th century in Damascus, Ibn Jubayr wrote of an organisation called the Nubuya that fought Shi''a Muslims in Syria. The Abbasid Caliph an-Nasir (1158–1225) approved of and supported futuwwa. In 1182 he organised a warrior futuwwa order that was for all practical purposes a knightly order with mounted warriors. He became the head of this order and gathered ruling princes and other notables to its membership. It continued for some time after the death of its founder. This military futuwa was also practiced by Javans, mercenary soldiers of 10th and 11th centuries in Khurasan, Persia (although they may have also had non-Muslim soldiers amongst them). Apparently it may have been a model for janissaries.',

This was, to all intents and purposes a heavy weapon, its rather formidable power and expense meant that only highly trained specialists were entrusted to operate them.

'Birkarlar were semi-Swedish merchants who dominated the cultural developments and colonisation of northern Sweden from around 1300 onwards. Despite the north lacking any real feudal system, since they were no lordships and the subjects were Sami (Lapplander) nomads, the only real ''nobility'' was hard cash and trade. Sweden saw the oppurtunities for good trade in the far north once Norrland had begun to stabilise. Contacts with the north were dealt a heavy blow when the Black Death hit Scandinavia through Hansa ships from England. The ghostly arrival of ships in Jutland, Denmark and Bergen where the crew were already all dead were a chilling harbinger of the devastation that was to follow. The colonisation of provinces such as Jämtland, Medelpad, Ångermanland and Härjedalen were hardest hit and the ruins of fairly newly developed villages, townships and agricultural communities would lie in ruins for hundreds of years until they were once again re-populated. Simply put, by the end of the 1300s they were not enough people in the entire country to support the economy. This was much the case as elsewhere in Europe. However the relative long-distance trade route from the Swedish capital region around Uppland to the far north mean that a taxes and more importantly a lack of tightfisted nobles meant that Sweden had an excellent resource network it could take advantage of without military or political risks.In the Lagmansting in Piteå in 1424 the lagman Nils Gustafsson (of the Rossviksätten) presided over a legal dispute between several groups of birkarlar. In the Thing document that followed the birkarlarna are referred to as lappefara (Lapp-journeymen), and ''allom Bircherlom'' -''all those Birchermen''. It was also stipulated in law that merchants or these Birkarlar ''nobles'' could not exact more trade commodity from the Lapps than they themselves could support in their own communities. The point was that Swedish law was very conscious of the fact that trade from the Lapps had to be in continual flow, and could not be allowed to be decimated by overuse riffua eller slitta af the fattiga Lappa''. The Birkarlar fulfilled a function as a lifeline between the north and the central government in lower Sweden, they were active between the Norwegians, the Novgorodians and were well-established even in Finland. The Portuguese Damianus a Goës who visited Sweden in the 1500s called the Birkarlar ''nobles in the north''. Their main commodities were meat, pelts, furs, hides and possibly hunting birds- all of which were extremely valuable once they reached mainland Europe or Britain, usually via the Hansa.',

Under Lusignan who was at that stage only the titular Count of Tripoli the order was set up with a view to being the inner guard for the Kingdom of Cyprus and specifically rallying Latins to the Lusignan claim on the Holy Land.

'Layknights of the Teutonic order, also called Confratres although this definition was not always clear nor was the term ''Halbbrüder''. However, knights that had come to support (even at times literally save the Ordenstaat) men particularly from German states and Bohemia saw themselves not as full brothers of the Order, but as ''relatives'' or Consanguinei- literally ''same blood''. These men were formally pilgrims but in reality were just nobles that had attached themselves to the Order''s forces as a form of penance or more cynically, to elevate their own status. Typically they only served for short campaigns, perhaps no more than a year. Most Orders particularly those in Spain or the Holy Land that were more stationary, had layknights attached to the Chapter Houses as Donati- who would literally donate and financially support the local monks, even working on their lands with them. For the Teutonic Order things were different whilst on the Northern Crusades, whilst it was relatively easy to acquire such men -some political wrangling was often required by the Order, and a few bribes to kickstart the call to arms in the homelands. However, in the field, these men lived off the Order and didn''t help on the Order''s estates to pay their way. Indeed, they were designed primarily as a sort of short-term military contractor. As such they couldn''t be kept on the lists for long, but since the Order knights themselves were fairly limited these conscripted crusaders were very useful in adding bulk to the Order''s forces. The Northern Crusades attracted adventurers from as far afield as Scotland and Hungary but not always of knightly stock, in fact many were merely sergeants.

'ČERĪK (also jerīk, from Mongol tserig “warrior[s]”), originally troops sent by an individual or camp (yort) to serve in the royal army). The čerīk system persisted in Iran for many centuries, in slightly varying forms. Jovaynī referred to the element drawn from settled areas and probably not of Mongol stock as čerīk-e pīāda (infantry), as opposed to the mounted Mongol cavalry. Čerīk service was compulsory: Naḵjavānī reported that since ancient times each yort was supposed to supply a number of men from a specific age group (čerīk yortčī) for the Mongol armies but that many tried to avoid such service. According to Jovaynī, the Mongol governors Mahmud Yalavāj and his son Masʿūd Beg abolished “compulsory service (muʾan) in the levies (ḥashar) and the cherig” in Transoxania for political reasons.  In the 7th-8th/13th-14th centuries the term čerīk was used mainly in the sense of “army,” and čerīkčī referred to an individual soldier (Rašīd-al-Dīn, Tārīḵ-e ḡāzānī). For military purposes the Mongols had divided their territory into regions called tomans (Pers. tūmān, Mong. tümän), each of which was to supply 10,000 men when called upon; such a contingent was commanded by an amir-e tūmān, each group of 1,000 men by an amir-e hazāra, each group of 100 men by an amīr-e sada, and each group of ten men by an amir-e čerīk (Rašīd-al-Dīn, Tārīḵ-e ḡāzānī). In reality, however, the toman almost always supplied fewer than 10,000 men; for example, two tomans in the region of Isfahan and the toman of Ḵūzestān sent only 1,000 and 277 men of the sedentary population respectively in the case of war (Rašīd-al-Dīn, Tārīḵ-e ḡāzānī). Some have therefore suggested that the term tūmān referred to an area with 10,000 inhabitants, rather than to a fixed levy of soldiers. Nevertheless, Rašīd-al-Dīn consistently uses the word čerīk in the sense of army and also in the collective sense of “the military” (mardom-e čerīk). Nomads also were all liable for military service, but the sedentary population was supposed to supply čerīk; each nine families (about 40 people) were to send one man. The terms čerīk and īl-jārī continued to be used in the sense of “irregular levies” during the Zand period, but apparently payments were no longer collected in cash. Karīm Khan Zand claimed that he could raise 20,000 čerīk in forty days’ time.',
'The term bīgār (corvée and human taxation) was very often used together with the term ḥašar (from Ar. ḥašara “to gather, bring together”) as synonyms (ḥašar and mard-e bīgārī on the construction of a palace). However, the term ḥašar also had different meanings: 1. auxiliary troops, usually peasant levy, mostly used for siege work, or as sappers, and some­times as a reserve (in central Asia in the Uzbek period a Turko-Mongol term qara čerik was used for such auxiliary troops rather than ḥašar); 2. communal help provided by relatives and the members of a village or neighborhood community to one another on various occasions (agricultural works, building of a house, family festivals, etc.). In the Khanate of Bukhara in the 10th-14th/16th-20th centuries, the term bīgār was most­ly replaced by the term mardekār (lit. “time-worker”; cf. mard-ebīgārī), which meant both the duty and a single worker performing it (as a synonym for such worker the term ḥašaṛčī was also used). Some documents, however, mention all three terms side by side: ḥašar, bīgār, and mardekār, and it is not clear what distinction, if any, was made among them.',

'The Turkomen also known as Oghuz Turks (a linguistic term designating the Western Turkic or Oghuz languages from the Oghur languages) were a historical Turkic tribal confederation in Central Asia during the early medieval Turkic expansion. The name Oghuz is just the Common Turkic word for ''tribe''. They are referred to as ''Western Turks'' because they moved west from other Turkic peoples after the Göktürk empire collapsed, and because the majority of the areas in which they inhabit today (except Turkmenistan and the Turkmen Sahra) are west of the Caspian Sea, while those referred to as ''Eastern Turks'' live east of the Caspian Sea. The founders of the Ottoman Empire were also Oghuz Turks. In the 9th century, the Oghuz Turks from the Aral steppes drove the Pecheneg Turks of the Emba region and the River Ural toward the west. In the 10th century they inhabited the steppe of the rivers Sari-su, Turgai, and Emba to the north of Lake Balkhash of modern day Kazakhstan. A clan of this nation, the Seljuks, embraced Islam and in the 11th century entered Persia, where they founded the Great Seljuk Empire. Similarly, in the 11th century a Tengriist Oghuz clan—referred to as Uzes or Torks in the Russian chronicles—overthrew Pecheneg supremacy in the Russian steppe. Harried by another Turkic horde, the Kipchaks—a branch of the Kimaks of the middle Irtysh or of the Ob—these Oghuz penetrated as far as the lower Danube, crossed it and invaded the Balkans, where they were either crushed or struck down by an outbreak of plague, causing the survivors either to flee or to join the Byzantine imperial forces as mercenaries (1065). Those Uzes or Torks who settled along the Russian frontier were gradually Slavicized though they also played a leading role as cavalry in twelfth and early thirteenth century Russian armies where they were known as "Black Hoods".... Oghuz warriors served in almost all Islamic armies of the Middle East from the eleventh century onwards, in Byzantium from the ninth century, and even in Spain and Morocco. They founded several dynasties and provided the core for several empires including the Seljuks, White Sheep Turcomans, Black Sheep Turcomans, Afsharids, Ottomans, Qajars, and Artuqids. In the Crusades, turcopoles, turcoples, turcopoli or turcopoliers (from the Greek: Τουρκόπουλοι, ''sons of Turks'') were locally recruited mounted archers employed by the Christian states of the Eastern Mediterranean. The crusaders first encountered turcopoles in the Byzantine army during the First Crusade. These auxiliaries were the children of mixed Greek and Turkish parentage, and were at least nominally Christian although some may have been practising Muslims. Some Byzantine turcopole units accompanied the First Crusade and may have provided a model for the employment of indigenous auxiliary light horse in the crusader states.',

'Ghāzī warriors depended upon plunder for their livelihood, and were prone to brigandage and sedition in times of peace. The corporations into which they organised themselves attracted adventurers, zealots and religious and political dissidents of all ethnicities. In time, though, soldiers of Turkic ethnicity predominated, mirroring the acquisition of Mamluks, Turkic slaves in the Mamluk retinues and guard corps of the caliphs and emirs and in the ranks of the ghazi corporation, some of whom would ultimately rise to military and later political dominance in various Muslim states. In the west, Turkic ghāzīs made continual incursions along the Byzantine frontier zone, finding in the akritai (akritoi) their Greek and Armenian counterparts. After the Battle of Manzikert these incursions intensified, and the region''s people would see the ghāzī corporations coalesce into semi-chivalric fraternities, with the white cap and the club as their emblems. The height of the organisations would come during the Mongol conquest when many of them fled from Persia and Turkistan into Anatolia. As organisations, the ghazi corporations were fluid, reflecting their popular character, and individual ghāzī warriors would jump between them depending upon the prestige and success of a particular emir, rather like the mercenary bands around western condottiere. It was from these Anatolian territories conquered during the ghazw that the Ottoman Empire emerged, and in its legendary traditions it is said that its founder, Osman I, came forward as a ghāzī thanks to the inspiration of Shaikh Ede Bali. In later periods of Islamic history the honorific title of ghāzī was assumed by those Muslim rulers who showed conspicuous success in extending the domains of Islam, and eventually the honorific became exclusive to them, much as the Roman title imperator became the exclusive property of the supreme ruler of the Roman state and his family. The Ottomans were probably the first to adopt this practice, and in any case the institution of ghāzī  reaches back to the beginnings of their state.',
'Etrâk is a word found in many Middle Eastern sources not least in the later Turkish Ottoman period as a reference to their own kind. Historically, all of the Western or Oghuz Turks have been called Türkmen or Turkoman. The word Etrâk was most well-known referring to the warrior units called Uci. Uc means border in Turkic, and were literally men of the borderlands, they joined the campaigns under the command of Amirs, and proved their worth as hardened soldiers, fast and excellent cavalry as a rule, all Turks were horse archers, with mixed equipment but always with the standard silk armour and recurved bow. ',
'When the Turks overran Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 the majority of the subject population were of different ethnic groups (non-Turks) but culturally they were unified Romans (Byzantines). The Romans (Rûmî) continued a tradition of suburban feudalism, living on semi-rural estates spread out in the valleys, slopes and outskirts of the vast sprawling cities they were generally speaking civilised and had a tradition as well-equipped, dependable levies.',
'From Albania, they were mercenaries like the Stradiotti Cavalry. They were very popular with nations like the Venetians who due to their homelands lacked any real cavalry. ',
'Though Venice was famous for its navy, its army was equally effective. In the 13th century, most Italian city states were already hiring mercenaries, but Venetian troops were still recruited from the lagoon, augmented by cavalry auxillaries from Dalmatia such as the famous Schiavoni. The register of 1338 estimated that 30,000 Venetian men were capable of bearing arms; many of these were skilled crossbowmen, amongst these however were elite guardsmen that protected the Republic government, even from itself, due to the common conspiracies between rival mercantile families. The Quarantia was the Supreme Tribunal office also known as the the Council of the Forty, formerly established in 1179. Its main purpose was a form of senate, although more keyed to maintaining rigid legal controls on all citizens. The office was naturally not immune to corruption or infiltration by the signoria families, however as an ideal it was a bastion of the government. The Guardia were the city police, responsible for high level militia duties, guarding the banks and the important members of state.',
'Though Venice was famous for its navy, its army was equally effective. In the 13th century, most Italian city states already were hiring mercenaries, but Venetian troops were still recruited from the lagoon, plus feudal levies from Dalmatia (the very famous Schiavoni or Oltremarini) and Istria. The Fanti da mar was the marine corps of the Republic. Their creation is traced back to the time of the Fourth Crusade when the Doge Enrico Dandolo ordered constituted a regiment of ten companies, variously deployed on ships. This body took part in the subsequent Siege of Constantinople (1203-1204). They wore a red jacket, blue shirt and pants, trendy ungara, black cap with bow and boots. In times of emergency, all males between seventeen and sixty years were registered and their weapons were surveyed, with those called to actually fight being organized into companies of twelve. The register of 1338 estimated that 30,000 Venetian men were capable of bearing arms; many of these were skilled crossbowmen. As in other Italian cities, aristocrats and other wealthy men were cavalrymen while the city''s conscripts fought as infantry. By 1450, more than 3,000 Venetian merchant ships were in operation. Most of these could be converted when necessary into either warships or transports. The government required each merchant ship to carry a specified number of weapons (mostly crossbows and javelins) and armour; merchant passengers were also expected to be armed and to fight when necessary. A reserve of some 25 (later 100) war-galleys was maintained in the Arsenal. Galley slaves did not exist in medieval Venice, the oarsmen coming from the city itself or from its possessions, especially Dalmatia. Those from the city were chosen by lot from each parish, their families being supported by the remainder of the parish while the rowers were away. Debtors generally worked off their obligations rowing the galleys. Rowing skills were encouraged through races and regattas.',
'By 1303, crossbow practice had become compulsory in the city of Venica, with citizens training in groups. As weapons became more expensive and complex to operate, professional soldiers were assigned to help work merchant sailing ships and as rowers in galleys. The company of ''Noble Bowmen'' was recruited in the later 14th century from among the younger aristocracy and served aboard both war-galleys and as armed merchantmen, with the privilege of sharing the captain''s cabin.',
'Schiavoni is an Italian ethnonym literally meaning "Slav" in Old Italian: originally, this term indicated origins in the Slavic lands of Dalmatia and Istria, when under the rule of the Republic of Venice. The majority of these men were fishermen along the coast who in Venice''s earlier days were ''Dalmatian pirates'', or soldiers of the smaller Maritime Republics that dotted the coast.',
'The cernide or cernida (also known as the cranide in Dalmatia) were territorial armies of the Veneto and Istria that annually received some military training. The name cernida derives from the fact that the one or two young men were chosen (cerniti, or Italian for selections) for every ten from among the young men resident in these areas. These units could thus be mobilized quickly, unlike the army, which was slower to recruit and slower moving. They were formed of soldiers on annual service, with an obligation to gather for brief training periods four times a year, and accounted in total for about 30,000 men.',
'The Victual Brothers were a multinational freebooter guild, they were at first hired by the Dukes of Mecklenburg and the Hanseatic League to harass Danish shipping, especially when Albrecht of Mecklenburg came to the throne of Sweden. In 1393 they sacked the town of Bergen for the first time in its history and in 1394 they conquered Malmö. All along the Rostock coast they held harbours and outposts, even holding ground in Frisia and Finland. In 1395 Queen Margaret of Denmark ascended the Swedish throne and unified Scandinavia under the Kalmar Union, she hired Richard II’s English navy to fight back the Victuals and in 1398 she invited the Teutonic Order to invade and purge the entire island, ending the guild for good and opening Wisby, their main base up to the machinations of the Hansa.',

'Used by Saladin in his assault on Acre, it was also known amongst the Moors. Disassembled 4 could be carried on a single cart. Assembled, it took 11 mules to either move or to power the machines, which infers it was mainly comprised of poles and ropes. It probably used a frame system of scaffolds (al Tarsusi records it as being over 16 ft high) and used a torsion skein engine to fire stones or bolts. The two-armed bow version of the weapon was highly-regarded, firing explosives from mixed silk and horsehair strings, it had a crew of 20 men. The head of the bolt itself weighed 2 KGs although there are no records of the actual bolt weight itself, which seems to infer that it was the ''warhead'' of the bolt which was important. Al Zaradkash in his ''An elegant book on mangonels'' called the weapon a ''kuskanjil''. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor is even known to have acquired one. al Tarsusi, Saladin''s military technical advisor described the machine as for being used against ''the greatest towers and any obstacle, for none can withstand it''. The engineering principle behind the weapon was known in Europe as the espringald, it seems to have been very ineffective in its execution however which is why it defaulted to or was confused with the common ballista/field crossbow. Nonetheless the ziyar itself was the main inspiration to Da Vinci for his ''Great Crossbow.'' A possible variant of this was the so-called ''ox bow'' or Kaman-i gav. Mongols are documented as fighting in India and Iran using this formidable siege weapon which probably had Chinese engineers operating it. It fired incendiary missiles at a distance of 2,500 metres and was used successfully against castles unsurprisingly.',

'The Englishman John Hawkwood''s company grew out of the German Albert Sterz''s White Company during 1361 to 1365 in Italy. Although Sterz''s company included mainly Germans and Hungarians, Hawkwood known as ''Giovanni Acuto'' to the Italians, quickly gathered English immigrant mercenaries to him. Many were like himself experienced survivors of the Hundred Years War, they become so numerous that they easily lended him their support. John Hawkwood first gained command of the Company in 1365 by election. Sterz''s company basically split off from the English and they found themselves more than capable of independent ''work'' so themselves broke from the White Company. The new English unit contained large numbers of infantry, particularly English longbowmen. These could be mounted on horses as were the 600 involved in the Battle of Castagnaro in 1387. When Pope Gregory XI''s war against Milan ended in 1375, many Florentines feared that the pope would turn his military attention toward Tuscany; thus, Florence paid off Gregory XI''s main military commander, John Hawkwood, with 130,000 florins, extracted from local clergy, bishops, abbots, monasteries, and ecclesiastical institutions, by an eight-member committee appointed by the Signoria of Florence, the otto dei preti. Hawkwood also received a 600 florin annual salary for the next five years and a lifetime annual pension of 1,200 florins.',

'Referred to by Al-Dinawari in the 800s as ''Those who sacrifice their lives or seek death''. They were the sons of knights and formed a corps that surrounded the Shah, and was a tradition dating back to the famous ''Immortals''.',
'The word dihqanan was often used to differentiate the old Zoroastrian Persian elite, from the azadan who were the noble cavalry (asbaran), the term was applied to the village lords (dihqanan) as knights, but also to refer to priestly and learned tiers of society. The dihqanan are cited in numerous sources as opponents of the Arab Muslim incursions on Persian society, culture, religion and power. In the Middle Ages when Zoroastrianism was marginalised and even persecuted despite being an extremely deep-rooted but altogether socially ostracised religion, the term dihqanan continued to be used to refer to the old elite however. ',
'Azadan nobility was first formed in Parthian times, and was carried over into the Sassanid state, where they were a force to be reckoned with. They accompanied the king in the wars and displayed great courage and discipline. They are clearly the forerunners and founders of the ''Knights'' of later Arab history. The Aztan (Azadan, آزادان, ''freemen'') jealously guarded their status as descendants of the ancient Aryan conquerors and rulers of the mass of originally non-Aryan peasantry far beyond the borders of Iran. These Azatan formed a numerous minor aristocracy of lower-ranking administrators, mostly living on their small estates and providing the cavalry backbone of Sassanid army. Most prestigious among them were the armoured ''Aswaran'' اسوران who normally decided the outcome of a battle. Despite their downfall in the 7th century AD, the legacy of the Savaran endured in Europe, the Caucasus, India and the Muslim world. It was the elite cavalry of Sassanid Persia, who were the forerunners of the later Arabian Faris, the English knights, the Caucasian horsemen, the Indian Suwar (derived from Persian Savar), and the Turkish Tarkhans. In point of fact, certain of the later Muslim heavy cavalry, such as the non-Steppe Mamluks, were possibly the descendants of the clibanarii cavalry, as they used similar weapons and tactics. The amount of money involved in maintaining a warrior of the Asawaran (Azatan) knightly caste required a small estate, and the Asawaran knightly caste received that from the throne, and in return, were the throne''s most notable defenders in time of war. As Persian nobles under Turkish rule they were officially Sunni by religion but were still tightly bound to their Zoroastrian traditions, elements of this old Persian nobility could be found across the old domains of Persia and into Armenia.',
'In Sassanid times a sarhang was an officer, usually of elite cavalry. In medieval times the term was used as a rank of honour for special forces guards, usually night guards of the palaces and imperial quarters and especially of the headquarters during campaign.'

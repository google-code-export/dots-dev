'These men of faith essentially serve as a mobile conversion force, spreading their faction''s religion wherever they travel.

'An assassin is the ideal man to call upon when a foreign target is either too well defended by armed forces for a frontal assault, or if you wish to strike without it being obvious that it was you that gave the order. Not only can assassins take out live targets, they can also bring down a building marked for sabotage, and can even specialise in this field of destruction.',

The abilities and retinue that an admiral can develop throughout their career can improve their abilities to fight and navigate more efficiently.

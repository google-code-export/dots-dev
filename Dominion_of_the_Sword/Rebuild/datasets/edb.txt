'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',
'The sheer size of these magnificent defences is enough to awe the peasants who work in their shadow! These walls are extremely costly, but that price guarantees security against all but the most well-prepared besieging force. Thanks to strong towers, battlements and gatehouses, the defenders can make any assault a chancy business.',

'A Shipwright has the slipway, wood seasoning stores and manpower needed to build ships for a strong fleet. The improved port buildings - and simple improvements like creating permanent wharves along a waterfront - allow more trade to occur.',
'A Dockyard allows the construction of larger ships, and the improved wharves make trade easier to manage. Goods from all over the world pass through the docks, bringing wealth and excitement into the lives of citizens.',
'A Naval Dockyard allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the port to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',

'Land Clearance is the first step on the road to establishing organised farming in the countryside, and ensuring that a region will begin to grow and prosper. Though there is little more to land clearance than deforestation and basic tilling of the soil, any area where the local establishment has not taken such measures to make the land workable will struggle to feed its populace.',
'Communal Farming is the natural progression from land clearance, where the farming communities adopt a system of centralised management. By sharing common resources and transportation, communal farming sees all the individual farms in the community achieve a level of productivity, prosperity and security that would otherwise be unattainable.',
'Crop Rotation is a more advanced farming system that maximises the use of farming districts all year round. Going to the trouble of planting different crops in different seasons not only ensures that something is always growing, varying the produce actually improves the soil quality markedly so as to reap greater harvests all year round.',
'Irrigation represents the final frontier in terms of actively improving farming districts. Water is diverted to crops via a system of man-made channels dug into the earth so as to dramatically improve soil fertility. Although irrigating the land is grand and arduous task, and maintaining proper irrigation is an ongoing job, the benefits from the resulting surplus of food produced make the endeavour well worth it.',

'The fief (alternatively, fee, feoff, fiefdom) or feudum (in Latin), under the system of medieval European feudalism, often consisted of inheritable lands or revenue-producing property granted by a lord to a vassal who held seisin in return for a form of allegiance (usually given by homage and fealty).',
'Following the establishment of Kingdom of Bohemia and its ever closer relations to the Empire, German settlers were (either by their own free will or by invitation) settling the vast empty lands of Bohemia. These were usually around the borders and by clearing portions of the great forest. This increased the population of Bohemia rapidly but was also the origin of the German-Czech heritage and its consequences in following centuries and especially in modern times.',
'With the colonization well under way and often the native population wishing for better life and opportunities many more cities were founded since 12th century and especially in 13th century in previously uninhabited or less inhabited regions of Bohemia. These brought more income from trade and other economic activities but also greater squalor and health risks. The cities are nevertheless essential for securing the successful future!',
'The growing wealth and power of the cities of Bohemia led to a demand for codifying the rights and laws associated with them. The first city charters and rights were historically adopted in Bohemia in the middle of the 12th century with their gradual boost until the peak of the 16th century.',
'(Now Saint) Agnes of Bohemia, Czech Princess and daughter of the king, was the main driving force behind establishing the Order of the Cross with the Red Star as the branch of Hospitaller orderp.

'Hospices soon developed into medieval hospitals providing the best contemporary health care for the people, under the supervision of the Order of the Cross with the Red Star.',
'HQ of the Order of the Cross of the Red Star signifies its firm rooting in Bohemia and close ties with the kingdom. It brings more law and also establishes access to the original Hospitaller order. From here operations of the order beyond borders of Bohemia are managed.',
'The first and rather basic system of the control of the province. System of castles with appointed and often changed Castellans were the primary means how Princes of Bohemia ruled the province. The so called ruling "from the saddle" ensured that the ruler did not lose control of the province.',
'The final development stage of the Kingdom of Bohemia was a form of commonwealth of lands under the Czech Crown. Establishing the firm link between the crown and the vassal province boosts loyalty and authority as well as tax revenue and raises the status of the region almost to that of a Czech homeland.',

'National armies were gathered for campaigns in a specific office usually attached to weapon stores. Men from all over the province would assemble and usually have their names taken down and documented in a roll either individually or under a unit officer/sergeant. Often a man would be banded into local groups, arriving with his family or neighbours and they would be documented for pay as a group in this respect. Once the names were taken, terms of service and pay established and the men organised into fighting bodies or companies the army would then mobilise from this centre.',
'Standing armies of the professional (above militia level) were quite rare or fairly small and localised. Nobles and guard retinues to lords or kings were a development based on central authority, continued warfare, the need for internal state security and the organisation to exact taxation. Extended retinues could form a core ''army'' around a duke, bishop or king and would generally be continually deployed to earn their keep, usually in one of the roles mentioned above. At ''home'' they would live, eat, sleep and train together where their loyalty could be properly overseen and their ability to be quickly mobilised enhanced.',
'As campaigns became more regular, the need for proper organisation of units from the noble to levy levels was seen as a sensible way of maintaining order in battle and cohesion for tactics and strategical surety. Fields and flat areas such as marshlands were often used for military drills. FitzStephen in the time of King Henry III describes the militias and standing army training together iin the area of Aldgate, making reference to the military exercises conducted annually, as well as other sports with a military bent, such as tournament-type activities on the Thames or the frozen marshes, javelin throwing, and hand-to-hand combat. In his opening paragraph, he praises in the same breath the commercial success of the townsmen and their physical prowess, while at the same time boasting of the strength of its fortifications. His estimate of London forces comprised 60,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry.',
'Usually seen as a post-medieval concept, regiments (related to the word ''regime''- rule or organisation) was merely the term applied to constitutions of companies or societas armorum assembled into a larger body. Typically formed around the provincial capital, or capital of the realm these armies would be relatively small in number during peactime but comprised the royal administrative officers and the masters-at-arms, standard-bearers, squires and a large host of logistical staff who could not be disbanded due to the needs of military efficiency. These were usually all under control of the monarch and/or the Marshall of the Realm. When nobles and levies were called up into service it would be this core ''headquarters'' that would be responsible for overseeing pay, terms of service, organisation and the enforcement of marshall law.',
'With the event of more serious attempts to create professional armies, particularly thanks to drawn-out campaigns such as the 100 Years War or the constant local fighting in Italy or Spain, the need to apply tactics and strategy beyond the previously accepted social boundaries of piety was required. Hardly comparable to schools or colleges, these ''academia'' were generally speaking no more than an idea imposed over the earlier military structure. The royal and national retinues would propogate specific organisational ideas and the doctrines of the ''science of war''. With the rise of the crossbow, longbow, gunpowder and sieging methods which neutralised the ''panzers'' of piety in the form of the knights, cost effective forces could be now maintained and kept on constant stand-by or actual deployment in campaigns.',
'In the 1300s warfare on the large scale had developed scientifically in great bounds. In the small scale it was also nurtured in Europe into martial arts, where the focus on nobles and their horsemanship was thrown out of the window. Although to be fair, some ''masters'' attempted to transfer and apply many of the old concepts to the continuing tradition the fact was that any man with a sword (pretty much the majority of the male population) could be taught to fight using martial arts. Masters such as the German Johannes Lecküchner, Hans von Speyer, Peter Falkner, Paulus Kal and Hans Folz all developed advanced (and most importantly documented) schools of fighting using various weapons such as polearms, heavy swords, and light swords with bucklers, even the use of the dagger- traditionally used by lower ranks for killing unhorsed knights using the long blade to delve between the armour. Italian schools were also prominent: in the words of the Pisan Fillipo Vadi "It is good to measure blows and steps, To find your trust in science, Fencing is born from geometry."',
'The word ''limes'' was utilized by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier. The "Roman Limes" represented the border line of the Roman Empire at its greatest extent in the 2nd century AD. It stretched over 5,000 km from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The remains of the Limes today consist of vestiges of built walls, ditches, forts, fortresses, and civilian settlements. The word ''limes'' gave rise to the English ''limits'' and other European equivalents, ''city limits'' were a similar concept to the colonial ''limes'' of an empire, either Roman of medieval. The Limes Saxoniae (Latin for "Limit of Saxony"), also known as the Limes Saxonicus or Sachsenwall ("Saxon Wall"), was a limes or border between the Saxons and the Slavic Obotrites, established about 810 in present-day Schleswig-Holstein. After Charlemagne had finally conquered the Saxon lands, he signed the 811 Treaty of Heiligen with the neighbouring Danes and may at the same time have reached a border agreement with the Polabian Slavs in the east. As no major fortifications existed, the Limes mainly followed natural obstacles like bogs and thick wood. According to Adam of Bremen''s description in the Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum about 1075 AD states that it ran from the Elbe river near Boizenburg northwards along the Bille river to the mouth of the Schwentine at the Kiel Fjord and the Baltic Sea. It was breached several times by the Slavic Obotrites (983 and 1086) and Mieszko II Lambert of Poland (1028 and 1030). The Limes became irrelevant during the first phase of the Ostsiedlung, when Count Henry of Badewide campaigned against the Wagrian lands in 1138/39 and the Slavic population was Germanized by German, mostly Saxon, new settlers. Limes represents the first aspect of colonisation- the establishment of an imperial boundary.',
'Civitas Finitima was a fontier settlement. These regional capitals were considered fairly dangerous places since enemies, either military, political, cultural or economic were beyond the very close boundary of the ''empire'' or faction. Nonethless it was exactly for this reason that populations quickly swelled into these areas where trade and commerce was seen as a worthwhile endeavour and poorer people or those wishing to escape oppression and indentured service in the homelands could establish new lands and farmsteads in the colonies- typically using the old population as serfs or slaves.',
'To accept a province as a vassal, was to recognise its status as part of the realm and usually given to a specific governor. Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus "servant", a term used as part of feudalism in medieval Europe, where one enters into mutual obligations to a monarch, usually in the form of military support and mutual protection, in exchange for certain privileges, usually to include land held as a fiefdom. This system can be applied to similar systems in other feudal societies. Although related, a fidelity, or fidelitas, is somewhat different as it is a sworn loyalty, subject to the king. The stratification of a fighting band of vassals into an upper group composed of great territorial magnates, strong enough to ensure the inheritance of their benefice to the heirs of their family, and a lower group of landless knights attached to a "count" or "duke" might roughly be correlated with the new term "fief" that was superseding "benefice" in the 9th century. The social settling out process also received impetus in fundamental changes in conducting warfare. As the example of the Huns demonstrated to the Romanised world that cavalry superseded a melee of fighting men on foot in determining the outcome of battles, the cost of maintenance of a mounted and increasingly armoured fighting force was inflated. A mounted vassal needed wealth to equip the band of mounted fighters he was under obligation to contribute to his lord''s frequent disputes, and wealth, where a money economy had disappeared, was only to be found in land and its productions, which included peasants, as much a resource of the land as wood and water.',
'A commendation ceremony (commendatio) is a formal ceremony that evolved during the Early Medieval period to create a bond between a lord and his fighting man, called his vassal (Latin vassus). The first recorded ceremony of commendatio was in 7th century France, but the relationship of vassalage was older, and predated even the medieval formulations of a noble class. The lord''s "servant" (vassus) might be born unfree, but the commendatio freed him. When two men entered into a feudal relationship, they underwent a ceremony known as commendation ceremony. The purpose of the commendation was to make a chosen person a vassal of a lord. The commendation ceremony is composed of two elements, one to perform the act of homage and the other an oath of fealty. The physical position for Western Christian prayer that is thought of as typical today—kneeling, with hands clasped—originates from the commendation ceremony. Before this time, European Christians prayed in the orans, which is the Latin, or "praying" position that people of many religions had used in antiquity: standing, with hands outstretched, a gesture still used today in many Christian rituals and deriving from a pagan salute to the sun forming a bodily cross. The kneeling and clasped hands position was to signify an almost bound position as if the hands and feet were tied, this showed that the servant was mentally and physically subject to the lord.',
'The fief (alternatively, fee, feoff, fiefdom) or feudum (in Latin), under the system of medieval European feudalism, often consisted of inheritable lands or revenue-producing property granted by a lord to a vassal who held seisin in return for a form of allegiance (usually given by homage and fealty). Not only land but anything of value could be held in fief, such as an office, a right of exploitation (e.g., hunting, fishing) or any other type of revenue, rather than the land it comes from. In the 10th and 11th centuries the term "fief" (feudum) could be used either to describe dependent tenure held by a man from his lord, as the term is used now by historians, or it could mean simply "property". It lacked a precise meaning until the middle of the 12th century, when it received formal definition from land lawyers. Historically the fiefs of the 11th and the 12th century derived from two separate sources. The first was land carved out of the estates of the upper nobility. The second source was allodial land transformed into dependent tenures. During the 10th century in northern France and the 11th century in France south of the Loire, local magnates either recruited or forced the owners of allodial holdings into dependent relationships and they were turned into fiefs. The process occurred later in Germany, and was still going on in the 13th century. In 13th-century England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy the term "feodum" was used to describe a dependent tenure held from a lord by a vassal in return for a specified amount of knight service and occasional financial payments (feudal incidents).',

'Conscription represents the call to arms in a region, where the ruler raises a national army for rapid deployment. Conscription buildings allow European factions to quickly gain access to a wide range of units without the need for a developed military infrastucture such as stables, barracks or bowyers. Instead, each tier of the conscription allows a mix of unit types dependent on social class. The higher the conscription level the more elite and noble the units available. Be careful however, conscription was extremely unpopular with the people, and should only be used in emergencies for defence or summoning large armies for a campaign. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands! This level requires Provincial Charters, and allows access to levies from the countryside.',

'The term quintain (O. Fr. quintaine/quintaina, from Lat. quintana, a street between the fifth and sixth maniples of a camp, where warlike exercises took place), also known as pavo (or peacock), was often used to refer collectively to a number of lance games, often used as training for jousting, where the competitor would attempt to strike an object with his lance, sword or other weapon. The common object was a shield or board on a pole (usually referred to, confusingly, as ''the quintain''), although a mannikin was sometimes used. It was not unknown for a seated armoured knight to act as the target. This game was open to all, popular with young men of all classes. While the use of horses aided in training for the joust, the game could be played on foot, using a wooden horse or on boats (popular in 12th-century London). This military training tended to keep the lads out of trouble!',
'Hastilude is a generic term used in the Middle Ages to refer to many kinds of martial games. The word comes from the Latin hastiludium, literally "lance game"''. By the 14th century, the term usually excluded tournaments and was used to describe the other games collectively; this seems to have coincided with the increasing preference for ritualistic and individualistic games over the traditional mêlée style. It draw spectators from afar, which allowed trade and fairs, but also brought crime, prositution and the spread of diseases from travellers shacked into rough conditions.',
'Roger of Hoveden (1174 - 1201), an English chronicler., described tournaments as "military exercises carried out, not in the spirit of hostility (nullo interveniente odio), but solely for practice and the display of prowess (pro solo exercitio, atque ostentatione virium)." During the Early Middle Ages such cavalry games were still central to military training as is evidenced by Louis and Charles'' military games at Worms in 843. At this event, recorded by Nithard, the initial chasing and fleeing was followed by a general melee of all combatants. But the tournament, properly so called, does not appear in Europe before the 11th century. Medieval people themselves devised myths about its origins. A chronicler of Tours in the late twelfth century records the death, in 1066, of an Angevin baron named Geoffroi de Preulli, who supposedly "devised (invenit) tournaments." Tournaments centred on the melee, a general fight where the knights were divided into two sides and came together in a charge (MFr ''estor''). Jousting, a single combat of two knights riding at each other, was a component of the tournament, but was never its main feature. Knights would come from all over Christendom as a means to make a name for themselves, advertise their services to foreign royalties who might wish to recruit them into their retinues or offices of command. It was also a chance to court princesses.',
'The pas d''armes or passage of arms was a type of chivalric hastilude that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. It involved a knight or group of knights (tenans) who would stake out a traveled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass (venans or "comers") must first fight, or be disgraced. If a traveling venan did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the venan chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way. There are many thousands of accounts of pas d''armes during this period. One notable and special account is that of Suero de Quiñones who in 1433 established the Passo Honroso ("Pass[age] of Honour") at the Órbigo bridge in Castile. This road was used by pilgrims all over Europe on the way to shrine at Santiago de Compostela and it was June when thousands would pass. Suero and ten knights promised to fight 300 times ("break 300 lances") before leaving the pas d''armes. He and his men fought for over a month, an account of which is left to us in great detail by town notary Don Luis Alonso Luengo who kept a first-hand chronicle (later published as Libro del Passo honroso). After 166 battles Suero and his men were so injured they could not continue and declared the mission complete. Although it sounds very honourable, this manner of picking fights from every man of sergeant and noble class meant that vendettas and claims on each others'' estates quickly descended into turmoil.',

'Prince-Bishopric',
'Prince-Archbishopric',
'In relation to the interior the archiepiscopal authority, consisting of Prince-Archbishop and Chapter, it had to find ways to interact with the other bearers of authority. These were gradually transforming into the Bishopric''s Estates (German: Stiftsstände), a prevailingly advisory body, but decision-taking in fiscal and tax matters. The bishopric''s Estates were by no means homogenous and therefore often quarreled for they consisted of the hereditary aristocracy, the service gentry, non-capitular clergy, free peasants and burghers of chartered towns. The modus vivendi of interplay of the Estates and the archiepiscopal authority, being in itself divided into the Prince-Archbishop and the Chapter, became the quasi constitution of the Prince-Archbishopric. However, the interplay was not determined by fixed standards of behaviour. While the consecutive Archbishops worked on discarding the bishopric''s Estates from the political landscape, the latter fought for the enforcement of the modus vivendi to become a real constitution. The Chapter often swung between increasing its authority by fighting the Estates jointly with the Prince-Archbishop and repelling his absolutist intentions by making common cause with the Estates. All parties made use of means like bluffing, threat, obstructionism, corruption, horse-trading and even violence.',

'"Dagome iudex" is the name applied to one of the earliest documents believed to relate to Poland. In it the royal domains are clearly described albeit with a few inconsistencies with later terminology. The boundaries of the "Gniezno" state are described as extending to the "Long Sea" (the Baltic), Prussia, Rus'', Kraków, Moravia and the Oder River. Lesser Poland is taken account by the mention of its capital, Kraków ("craccoa"). Between ''alemura'', probably Olomouc, and Upper Lusatia region of the Milceni (terra mileze) the border mentioned possibly included Silesia. The text seems to use ciuitas schinesghe as a synonyme of Greater Poland. Although the description of the boundaries would be rather more logical, if schenisghe meant the city of Szczecin. No mention of the word Poland actually occurs in the document but it is clear that this primitive idea of the state based on certain geographical locations was a key foundation for the later state. Of other regions and places in Mieszko''s territory, it mentions only Kraków and Lusatia, both without ''fines'' (border). Regions outside Mieszko''s rule, pruzze (Prussia) and russe (Russia), are mentioned with the word ''fines''.',
'The word is inherited from Proto-Slavic *větje, meaning ''council'' or ''talk'' (which is also represented in the word "soviet", both ultimately deriving from Proto-Slavic verbal stem of *větiti ''to talk, speak''). According to the Chronicles of Gallus Anonymus, the first legendary Polish ruler, Siemowit, who began the Piast Dynasty, was chosen by a wiec. The idea of the wiec led in 1182 to development of the Polish parliament, the Sejm.',
'"Sejm" stems from the Old Slavic word meaning "gathering". The power of early, various wiece ("councils") grew stronger during the time of Poland''s fragmentation (1146-1295), but it was only in the late 15th century that the Sejm became established as a regularly convening body.The confirmed history of the sejms goes back to 1182, the date of the first sejm at Łęczyca. However, Gallus Anonymus'' Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum (Chronicles and Deeds of the Dukes or Princes of the Poles) speaks of the 9th-century election of the legendary founder of the Piast dynasty, Siemowit, by a "sejm."',
'The Polish term "szlachta" designates the formalized, hereditary noble class. In official Latin documents, the old Commonwealth hereditary szlachta is referred to as "nobilitas". Some nobles however became tenants of wealthier gentry, while still retaining their constitutional superiority. It was not wealth or lifestyle (obtainable by the gentry) that constituted nobility, but hereditary, juridical status. It gained considerable institutional privileges during the 1333-1370 reign of Casimir the Great. In 1413, following a series of tentative personal unions between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the existing Lithuanian nobility formally joined the class. Socially these nobles had a great power and influence within the state and particularly over the Crown. This building represents the emergence of the Szlachta as a prominent part of the government, which parallels their authority during the era of Polish disunity. While they gained more power they also were prepared to develop their own military forces in rivalry with each other and a lack of faith in the Crown.',
'The Great Sejm was a more centralised development of the basic Sejm, where the king would call to council all the nobles, mayors, military commanders and the ecclesiarchy to deliberate over specific matters. This period marked a more dominant authority from the Crown, however during the era of the Commonwealth the Sejm severely limited the king''s powers. Its chambers reserved the final decisions in legislation, taxation, budget, and treasury matters (including military funding), foreign affairs, and titles of nobility. So while the benefits to the state were huge, the actual effect on the power struggles within the faction were variable.',
'The Studium Generale was established in 1364 by Casimir III the Great in Kraków. It is the oldest university in Poland. It is the second oldest university in Central Europe and one of the oldest universities in the world.Poland''s King Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country''s laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to found an institution of higher learning in Poland were rewarded when Pope Urban V granted him permission to set up an academy in Krakow. A royal charter of foundation was issued on 12 May 1364, and a simultaneous document was issued by the City Council granting privileges to the Studium Generale. The King provided funding for one chair in liberal arts, two in Medicine, three in Canon Law and five in Roman Law, funded by a quarterly payment taken from the proceeds of the royal monopoly on the salt mines at Wieliczka. The Cracow Academy''s development stalled upon the death of King Casimir, but the institution was re-founded in 1400 by King Władysław Jagiełło and his wife Jadwiga. The queen donated all of her personal jewelry to the academy, allowing it to enrol 203 students. The faculties of astronomy, law and theology attracted eminent scholars: for example, Stanisław of Skarbimierz, Paweł Włodkowic, Jan of Głogów, and Albert Brudzewski, who from 1491 to 1495 was one of Nicolaus Copernicus''s teachers. The university was the first university in Europe to establish independent chairs in Mathematics and Astronomy.The first chancellor of the University was Bishop Piotr Wysz educated in Prague, and the first professors were Czechs and Germans many of them trained at the Charles University, Prague.',
'The Trail of the Eagles'' Nests (Polish: Szlak Orlich Gniazd) is a line of border forts in south-western Poland, a chain of 25 medieval castles between Częstochowa and Kraków. The castles date mostly to the 14th century and were constructed by the order of King of Poland, Kazimierz the Great. They are named the "Eagles'' Nests" as most of them were located on large, tall rocks of the Polish Jura Chain, with many limestone cliffs, monadnocks and valleys. They were built along the 14th century Polish border with the province of Silesia which belonged to the Czech Kingdom of Bohemia at that time and to protect Krakow as well as important trading routes against foreign invaders. In time, the castles passed into the hands of various Polish aristocratic families.',
'The Privilege of Koszyce was a set of concessions made by Louis I of Hungary to the Polish szlachta in 1374. The privileges were granted in Košice. In exchange, one of Louis'' daughters (Catherine, Mary or Hedwig) was to ascend the throne of Poland after his death. Szlachta obtained undermentioned privileges: * tax benefits * tax exemption for the building and repair of castles. * Government offices only for Poles. * Full pay for Szlachta in military service. * release of building towns and bridges from royal monopoly. * full powers to the parliament int he absence of the King. The overall effect of these changes was to nationalise the government, and keep it out of the hands of the foreign rulers that had come to the throne. Whilst it seemed to empower the nobility with allowing them the rights to take their own local taxes and freedom to fortify their own fiefdoms, in fact it relieved the pressures on the Crown to police the country where the local lords could actually better govern their own autonomies. It also placed the responsibility for upkeep of public amenities in the hands of the local nobles whilst feudal service was now more difficult to demand.',

'Chapter house, although the establishment of an Order was a Chapter House of sorts it was usually referred to as a Domus. This Domus was typically a chapel monastery, naturally being a militarised order in addition to the farmland around the House to provide for the monks (sergeants, knights and laymen) it was neccessary to have grazing pastures for the warhorses and training grounds for the troops. The stables and armouries were typically adjoined with a blacksmith and even over time a small village would grow up outside of the Domus and its estates to support the chapter, all of this formed a small settlement or ''capital'' which acted as a proper base of logisitics for the Order in the region.',
'Mansion Estate. As a Chapter House grew in size and the forces it housed grew in number, the civilian support around the ''barracks'' would also increase exponentially. Typically the chapter would require its own estates much like any other monastery, hwoever due to the logistics of running a small military cohort there was a long list of administrative duties that had to be considered. The Mansio acted as an office for the accounts, records and provision of law over the estate, although it provided jobs for the civilians in the area it also ate up considerable tracts of arable land from the populace. Furthermore being an ecclesiastical institution it was land and manpower that was tax exempt, in fact it actually drained tax from the region due to the Church tithe.',
'A preceptory was historically the headquarters of any of the various orders of Christian Knights, such as the Knights Hospitaller and Templar, within a given geographic area. Governed by a preceptor, who was answerable to the Grand Master of the respective order. A preceptory''s main focus would be its church and accommodation for the brethren. Like any monastery it acted as a religious base in the province, but a preceptory was more in line with an Abbey in fact, so it had considerable effect in its locality. With such a large establishment its side-effects on the regional economy were increased, but on the other hand so was the power and efficiency of the military aspect. Local knights and sergeants would pay into the Order in order to receive a regular pay and more stable livelihood than trying to run their own estates. This is one reason the Orders became to popular and powerful, in fact they impacted on the power of the kings since his vassals were giving up their feudal service to him, their feudal command over the peasantry and donating their estates to the Order -making them Donati.',
'The Commandry was to all intents and purposes a Preceptory. It was a large base of operations and administration for an Order. Usually seen as the smallest division of an Order''s powers it was also its foundation- for it was via the network of these bases that recruitment, training, income and political influence emerged. What set a Commandry apart from a straightforward Preceptory was the heightened emphasis on military command. The Teutonic Order called their Commanderies; Kommende or Komturei which also has the meaning of ''office'' stemming from the French comptoir from the Latin computare - or ''calculate''. Therefore Commandries can be seen as essential headquarters for regional Order forces.',
'A keep or tower, this basic fortification was the prime defensive expansion of a commandry. Keeps were common structures in Europe, probably descended from Roman structures in design and function. A tower had natural practical benefits of allowing a raised lookout to see potential threats approaching, it also allowed missiles to be directed with better accuracy and power on attackers. The added pyschological effect of a tall imposing building increased belief in government in the area.',
'Fortification. A castellum was a small Roman detached fort used as a watch tower or signal station. The Latin word castellum is the source of the English word "castle", and was used in medieval times to cover a wide range of military defences. In the context of Militarised Monastic Orders, a castellum was major base of operations, usually found in frontier provinces such as the frontlines against Muslims or pagans in the Baltics, Iberia or the Holy Land. Naturally the cost of funding not only the contstruction of such a large site, but the manning of military and civilian support was very high. An Order''s castellum would include all the structrures needed to maintain, equip, feed and train a crusader army. A ruler would build such structures for the Orders, to encourage them to prosper and garrison his frontiers. Since the Orders were largely self-contained once they were up and running it was something of an investment.',
'Citadel. The Latin word castrum, was used by the ancient Romans to mean buildings or plots of land reserved to or constructed for use as a military defensive position. In classical Latin the word castra always means "great legionary encampment", both "marching", "temporary" ones and the "fortified permanent" ones, while the diminutive form castellum was used for the smaller forts, which were usually, but not always, occupied by the auxiliary units and used as logistic bases for the legions, as explained by Vegetius. In Latin the term Castrum is much more frequently used as proper name of geographical locations. In the Middle Ages, Castrum or Castrorum was naturally widely used in a variety of meanings, but in the context of the Militarised Monastic Orders it represented the paramount tier of operational bases such as the famous Templar headquarters in the Holy Land: Karak. A castrum was more than just a walled, towered structure it was a self-contained city including Horreae (granaries), Valetudinarium (hospital), Veterinarium (for horses), Fabrica ("workshop", metals and wood) and the Retentura ("stretching to the rear") was also a safekeep for plunder and a prison for hostages and high-ranking enemy captives. Of course more mundane amenities also existed in planned locations within the walls such as stone ovens for baking bread, latrines for hygiene, wells and irrigation ditches in hotter climates to augment agriculture.',
'Though it is incredibly common for peasant boys to learn how to string a bow as they grow up, any lord seeking to field a unit of archers or crossbowmen will first need to employ a professional Bowyer. Essentially a specialised carpenter, a bowyer has all the equipment needed to shape and treat bow wood, twine and resin for bow strings, as well as a healthy supply of bird feathers, for the rather mundane task of fletching countless arrows.',

'Clans, much of the foundation of Polish society was based on the social networks of the "szlachta" designating the formalized, hereditary noble class. They were not always rich but through social and cultural perspectives they had natural authority. In fact throughout the medieval period and beyond the szlachta clans were both a key aspect and a thorn in the side of the king, for the Polish nation. Prone to in-fighting, this caste also formed the backbone of the military and administrative sector.',
'Mayordom, a basic form of semi-republican government mediating between the szlachta and the Crown. Although the mayor or elder himself was not immune to corruption and bribes, for the most part it was a happy compromise of power and the elder in question was usually elected from among the lower classes which made the office superficially popular. The starosta (or starszyna) had judicial and military power over the ród/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. ',
'Strongholds called grόd were built where the old pagan religious cult was most powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger.

'In the Middle Ages each province had a character of infrastructure, typically a region would specialist in agriculture or in a series of urban satellite settlements. Of course, this is not to say that a region with towns had no farmlands- only that the focus of development and government, as well as the predominant type of scoiety was centred around different ways of life. In many localities, rulers would give ''Town Charters'', ''City Charters'', form ''Royal Burghs'' or grant specific trading rights, laws and tax freedoms as well as tolls and customs depending on the type of commerce in a province. A region that produced a great deal of a single commodity such as wool for export could be taxed at a higher or lower rate depending on the control a ruler wanted to apply to his local businesses. In other aspects, a region could have a mainly agricultural focus which although grew more slowly than the population centres grouped into towns in time the benefits of a highly developed farming community could be a great asset to a realm. Agricultural areas were typically much more stratified than the bourgeois (city folk), since peasants served landlords in a pyramid system. Life for farmworkers was very tough and poverty could be extreme, serfs were basically slaves and in poor conditions, peasants would frequently revolt. However as manors and estates developed around the households of the landed gentry life improved, encouraged trade, business and pastoral culture deep in the heart of a province. Towns focussed the population which allowed the concentration of culture and crafts. Where people were amassed together in one place, traders and merchants were more likely to congregate because they knew they had buyers for their commerce. Similarly, craftsmen and artisans were also abundant in these urban sites. Taxation was much easier to apply since the population could be more easily controlled in a concentrated area. However, populations boomed where people lived in such close quarters of each other and health, hygiene and law could easily spiral out of control as these secondary settlements advanced.',
'Hamlets were small settlements which were dependant on farmlands and usually were run by the communities of the hamlets as a collective. Hamlets could also grow up around trading crossroads such as by a ford in a river or around a natural resource such as mines, quarries or hunting grounds. People generally considered themselves free from the oppression of landlords and were the beginnings of commercial centres.',
'Villages would attract traders and merchants from the provincial capital, establishing a network around the major city and into the countryside at these specific communities where population were more densely packed than in the open landscapes of farmlands. Villages allowed concentrated points where people would seek work, and come to buy and sell where they knew there was trade.',
'Secondary towns could spring up in a province as satellites around a regional capital. A wealthy province would have trade centres in an entire network, covering a variety of specialist trades. However grouping people into small concentrated population centres had its drawbacks, since health was an issue especially multiplied by growth rates, furthermore the merchants who had become a kind of urban nobility resented taxation -these burghers or bourgeois often themselves formed or funded the militias, and emerged to challenge the counts and dukes. Nonetheless the benefits of having concentrated populations was the ability to set and to extract taxes more efficiently- as long as the people could be properly governed and policed. Crime was a further issue in urban areas, towns would attract poor people and those who had no means to earn a wage in trade other than theft or prostitution.',
'Medieval cities were always walled settlements, these were naturally defensive structures but had the added bonus of keeping the population inside the walls! Policing and taxation as well as other forms of control were much easier when the lords and their men could look down on the streets from the walls. However, a city could easily grow quicker than its walls could expand. Typically secondary settlements such as small towns and villages which had grown up around manors or small farmsteads some distance outside of a major city could in fact find themselves merging with the city as it grew. A river port as a trade outlet to a city, for instance, could quickly find itself as part of the city itself, transformed from a small riverside town into wharfs and warehouses. City quarters outside of the city walls were usually considered dangerous places, both due to bad law and hygiene. Suburbs grew up organically out of shacks and slums, usually based on the foundations of old manorial estates. This was in contrast to the streets inside the city walls which were developed by design and set up in quarters where different social classes were designated. Sewerage and human waste was merely dumped in the streets in medieval times, rubbish and effluent would float along the streets out of the side gates and down into the ditches (a primitive sort of moat) outside the walls. The poorest burials sites were also near to the suburbs, usually mass graves. During times of pestilence or war, a city would shut its gates to the poorfolk outside of the walls. Nonetheless it was a sign of a prosperous city that so many were drawn from far afield to seek a living even in the slums, and taxation and trade was still possible here after all.',
'Serfs were no more than slaves, they were at the very bottom of the social ladder. The word serf is related to ''service'' and they were in the feudal system in direct service to the landlords. Forced labor of serfs were bound to a hereditary plot of land owned by a lord in return for protection and the right to work on fields they leased from their landlords to maintain their own subsistence. Serfdom involved not only work in owner''s fields, but his mines, forests and roads. A freeman became a serf usually through force or necessity. Sometimes freeholders or allodial owners were intimidated into dependency by the greater physical and legal force of a local baron. Often a few years of crop failure, a war or brigandage might leave a person unable to make his own way. In such a case a bargain was struck with the lord. In exchange for protection, service was required, in payment and/or with labour. The majority of the population existed in serfdom or peasantry, in 11th century England freemen made up only 10% of the population.',
'Peasants were a slightly higher social level than serfs, but they were still very poor with very few civil rights. This made them prone to rebellions, especially since they made up the majority of the population and in their view at least held the true power of a province. The word ''peasant'' has come to identify an entire culture, and their way of life is often typified as iconic of the Middle Ages. What we term ''peasants'' were actually often bordars: persons ranking below a villein and above a serf in the social hierarchy of a manor, holding just enough land to feed a family (about 5 acres or 2 hectares) and were required to provide labour on the demesne on specified days of the week.',
'Villeins had more rights and higher status than the lowest serf, but were under a number of legal restrictions that differentiated them from freemen. Villeins generally rented small homes, with or without land. As part of the contract with their landlord, they were expected to spend some of their time farming the lord''s fields. The rest of their time was spent farming their own land. Like other types of serfs, they were required to provide other services, possibly in addition to paying rent of money or goods, such as military service as levies or maintenance work on roads or building. Villeins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord''s consent. However, in other regards, they were free men in the eyes of the law, for villeins were generally able to have their own property, unlike slaves. In many medieval countries, a villein could theoretically gain freedom by escaping to a city and living there for more than a year; and this was in fact a common occurrence especially with the rise of urban centres. But this naturally involved the loss of land and agricultural livelihood and these villeins newly arrived in a city were normally unskilled workes with no trade or craftsmanship skills and therefore were more likely to take to crime for survival, which gave the alternate spelling "villain" its modern meaning.',
'Freeholdings, were land held by freemen. In Europe they made up no more than 10% of the entire population and that included the nobility. Most freemen were not nobles but were of the status of sergeants, who formed clans and had recognisable households. Sergeants and other freemen would usually make up the top ranks of tenant farmers but were in fact themselves subject to the regional and local lords such as barons, just as the barons were subject to counts and dukes, and they in turn were subjects to kings. For this reason sergeants were often given the latin gloss ''servientes'' or servants, which can be quite misleading. Freemen were on the whole a key segment of the feudal order whereby nobility and peasantry could be mediated and taxation, law as well as freedoms could be enacted. They were in many ways the original middle class.',
'Encouraging markets in a region is not difficult nor expensive, it only takes a little organisation and some financial sponsorship to draw in merchants who then take it upon themselves to exploit any local means of business, whether it be natural or human resources.',
'Investing funds into militias across the region is a good way to protect the peasants and villages across the landscape, they take it upon themselves to help their lords to defend and maintain military strength. It aids law and even taxation, allowing a free men to always be on standby.',
'Sponsoring fairs in the countryside and villages of a province brings less direct impact and income than a fair in a large town or regional capital- nonetheless the overall boost to commerce and happiness is worth it.

'Serjeanty originated in the assignation of an estate in land on condition of the performance of a certain duty other than knight-service, usually the discharge of duties in the household of king or noble. It ranged from service in the king''s host, distinguished only by equipment from that of the knight, to petty renders scarcely distinguishable from those of the rent-paying tenant or socager. Serjeants (servientes) are already entered as a distinct class in Domesday Book (1086), though not in all cases differentiated from the barons, who held by knight-service. The majority of freeholders, squires and lesser gentry made up the sergeantry class, and they were entitled to bear their own arms at least in the early medieval period. As the concept of piety enlarged, the gap between baronial knights and free sergeants widened drastically, nonetheless they remained the backbone of most professional fighting forces and made up the bulk of the officers. Sergeantry combined with third level conscription allows European armies to recruit soldiers of the sergeant class.',
'Knights were generally of the baronial class, each man held an estate in feudal service to a lord which had military, judicial and economic duties.Tenure by barony was the higher feudal tenure of a lord who had subordinate knights. Originally, a barony was the land subject to a baron and could, in England after the Norman Conquest, consist of estates scattered throughout the country or in several regions (see, for example, the barony of the earl of Pembroke, with estates in England, Ireland, and Normandy). A medieval barony might comprise more than one manor or fief, and the principal manor often had a minor castle, however a barony constituted an administrative division of a country, of lower rank and importance than a county -barons were subject to the counts and dukes of the aristocracy. Combined with the fourth level of conscription this allows European armies to recruit knights and other soldiers from the higher levels of society.',

'In order for a region to have the full infrastructure to re-equip and maintain a large military force with armour, swords or even shoe hundreds of warhorses and packhorses on a regular basis- there needed to be a simpler basic foundation. Without proper access to more civil trades such as forestry- there could be no blacksmithing. Forestry was only one of the crafts that was needed to support more developed military logistics. Foresters would not only select, cultivate and shape wood for use in weapons such as spears and warmachines but also for making the buildings that would be used for firepits and furnaces that blacksmiths would need. Foresters would also constantly deliver charcoal, created via a highly skilled and patient process of smouldering wood in a confined container. Charcoal was the primary fuel used in forges that blacksmiths used to maintain and even, steady temperature in the fire to allow him to form his ironwork. Once the basic trades, crafts and merchants were in place- then the development of military support could begin.',
'Producing leather tans and hides for armour was a lengthy and highly skilled process, that if needed to equip an army -not just with simple body armour, but with grips for weapons such as swordhilts, making saddles, bridles, straps for steel harnesses, quivers for bows, etc a whole factory was required to support such a demand. A guild of tanners would combine the various tanners shops in a settlement and govern them to work in cohesion, to delegate work fairly and ensure a proper quota of quality and quantity was fulfilled for the local lords.',

'Most Templars came from aristocratic backgrounds, even the sergentry class were not mere peasants but upper middle class landowners who were trained in combat from birth. When they joined the Order, they turned over a good part of their private wealth to the Order. Even sympathetic lords and laymen made vast donations becoming Donati, often serving with the Order in battle for short periods to ensure their penance was done. What this meant was that the Temple was sitting on vast reserves of land and bullion by the thirteenth century. Their hundreds of thick-walled preceptories were not just places of worship but banks as well. This sprawling network of preceptories across Europe and the Middle East allowed the Order to offer a way for people to become more mobile without fear of losing their wealth. The Templars were founded orginally to guard pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land, only later becoming the ''divine wrath''. The system of investment with the Order grew organically out of this fundamental raison d''etre. Pilgrims, penitents, and crusaders deposited physical wealth and land deeds with the Order to save them from carrying around actual cash. These ''clients'' would then make withdrawals from another preceptory, for instance once they reached the Holy Land, and this was subject to interest. In the common event of the client''s death, the Order acted as clerks and executors of the Will, again taking their own cut for their services. The added bonus of dealing with the preceptories was that you knew you were leaving your money in a heavily guarded place. Interest and capital banking soon became the very fuel that drove the Order, making them welcome tennants to most of Europe not just along the pilgrimage routes. In turn the Templars became so rich as a military organisation that they were effectively the Pope''s personal army of elites. However, investment banking called ''usury'' in the Middle Ages was totally illegal and contrary to Christian law. It was for this reason that Jews were among the few allowed to work as bankers. The Church overlooked the Templar usuries, as it grew slowly out of the pilgrims'' safety deposit system and the Pope quickly saw the effectiveness of this commerce. It was argued that usury was against God''s law but since the Templars were acting for God they were not taking interest for themselves but for Holy purposes and the Crusades. However, the Order by virtue of being the very few legal bankers in Christendom were able to charge extortionate interest rates- much higher than the Jewish bankers- around 60%. This naturally made them very powerful and since they had the ability to physically enforce their forfeits they found that the royal families of Europe were becoming heavily indebted to the Order. This led to political conspiracies, much like the animosity and seizure of assets targetted against the Jews. Eventually, with the abetting of the Pope, the French King was able to frame the entire Order overnight for heresy and all their vast wealth was confiscated and divided up. Many of the Templars were burnt at the stake, some managed to escape to Portugal where they founded a new Order called the Knights of Christ.',

'While the Perfecti pledged themselves to ascetic lives of simplicity, frugality and purity, Cathar credentes (believers) were not expected to adopt the same stringent lifestyle. They were, however, expected to refrain from eating meat and dairy products, from killing and from swearing oaths. Catharism was above all a populist religion and the numbers of those who considered themselves "believers" in the late 12th century included a sizeable portion of the population of Languedoc, counting among them many noble families and courts. These individuals often drank, ate meat, and led relatively normal lives within medieval society—in contrast to the Perfecti, whom they honoured as exemplars. Though unable to embrace the life of chastity, the credentes looked toward an eventual time when this would be their calling and path.',
'Perfect (also known as a Parfait in French or Perfecti in Latin) was the name given to a monk of the medieval French Christian religious movement commonly referred to as the Cathars. They were expected to follow a lifestyle of extreme renunciation and austerity from the world which included abstaining from eating meat and avoiding all sexual contact. By that virtue they were recognized as trans-material (i.e. spiritualized) angels by their followers, the Credentes (Croyant in French, Believers in English). Perfectii were drawn from all walks of life and counted aristocrats, merchants and peasants among their number. Women could also become Perfects; Female Perfects were known as Parfaites or Perfectae.One of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum (Consolation) to the dying - this ensured admittance of the soul of the deceased to heaven and normally required a request from the recipient to a Perfect for the Consolamentum - this meant that many Perfects would not administer the Consolamentum to those who were beyond reason or sentient speech - as they clearly were not in a position to make the necessary request. One of the conditions of being a Credente was the uttering of the Convanenza, or Covenant, when encountering a Perfect, which involved the request for the Consolamentum should they be dying. This was aimed at enabling the Perfect to bestow the sacrament to those whose illness meant they could not ask for it. The Cathars believed in a doctrine of reincarnation interpreting the idea of Eternal Life promised in the Bible as meaning release from the cycle of successive births in this world, which they believed to be ruled over by Satan. The Consolamentum was thought to purify the soul through the Holy Spirit before death to enable its ascent to Christ. Naturally it was this priesthood, so widespread throughout France, the Low Countries and northern Italy as well as the Bogomil homelands of Thrace that were so heavily persecuted by the conventional Churches of Catholicism and Orthodoxy.',
'An individual entered into the community of Perfecti through a ritual known as the consolamentum, a rite that was both sacramental and sacerdotal in nature: sacramental in that it granted redemption and liberation from this world; sacerdotal in that those who had received this rite functioned in some ways as the Cathar clergy—though the idea of priesthood was explicitly rejected. The consolamentum was the baptism of the Holy Spirit, baptismal regeneration, absolution, and ordination all in one. The ritual consisted of the laying on of hands (and the transfer of the spirit) in a manner believed to have been passed down in unbroken succession from Jesus Christ. Upon reception of the consolamentum, the new Perfectus surrendered his or her worldly goods to the community, vested himself in a simple black or blue robe with cord belt, and sought to undertake a life dedicated to following the example of Christ and his Apostles — an often peripatetic life devoted to purity, prayer, preaching and charitable work. Above all, the Perfecti were dedicated to enabling others to find the road that led from the dark land ruled by the dark lord, to the realm of light which they believed to be humankind''s first source and ultimate end.',
'The term Pays Cathare, French meaning "Cathar Country" is used to highlight the Cathar heritage and history of the region where Catharism was traditionally strongest. Only though a modern term it does have some value as a reference to those homelands of Albigensian Catharism which was so successfual and popular not only in creating its own population of believers but being accepted by its neighbours who particularly in the case of the catholic population Toulouse were ready to fight and die -even as Catholics- to protect these men and women who were called Bons Chretiens: ''Good Christians''.',
'Cathar castles (in French Châteaux cathares) is a modern term used to designate a series of fortresses built by the French king on the southern border of his lands at the end of the Albigensian Crusade. Some of these sites, before the royal period, were fortified villages capable of sheltering Cathars and which were destroyed during the building of citadels. In Languedoc, the only real "Cathar castles" were fortified homesteads (castrum), such as Laurac, Fanjeaux, Mas-Saintes-Puelles. Certain sites like Lastours-Cabaret, Montségur, Termes or Puilaurens were castra before being razed to the ground and becoming royal citadels. The legend of Cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth. The only monuments which witnessed the events of the first half of the 13th century, and therefore the only ones which can claim the description "Cathar", given that the Cathar Church never built anything, are the small castles. Therefore the majority of castles given over to the Cathars- inkeeping with their largely pacifist faith were purely defensive structures where the last vestiges of persecuted ''heretics'' fled from the Catholics. Although the loss in territory to this religious minority involved a loss of land, it did in fact stabilise the outlying regions and enable a form local autonomies that would defend themselves independently from Albigensian Crusaders.',
'The Inquisition was established in 1229 to uproot the remaining Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, Carcassonne and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it finally succeeded in extirpating the movement. Cathars who refused to recant were hanged, or burnt at the stake. From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of Montségur was besieged by the troops of the seneschal of Carcassonne and the archbishop of Narbonne. On 16 March 1244, a large and symbolically important massacre took place, where over 200 Cathar perfects were burnt in an enormous fire at the prat des cramats near the foot of the castle. Moreover, the Church decreed lesser chastisements against laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars, at the 1235 Council of Narbonne. Inquisitors required heretical sympathisers - repentant first offenders - to sew a yellow cross onto their clothes. A popular though as yet unsubstantiated theory holds that a small party of Cathar perfects escaped from the fortress before the massacre at prat des cramats. It is widely held in the Cathar region to this day that the escapees took with them Le Tresor Cathar. What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars'' accumulated wealth made up of the sizeable donations of the converted nobility of the area as well as any property of those that became Perfecti. This ''treasure'' whether material or literary was quite arguably the very impetus that continued to drive the survival of Catharism throughout Europe well into the late Middle Ages where they were seen in the riots and persecutions in as far afield as Russia, the Low Countries and Spain.',

'Usury from Medieval Latin usuria, "interest", or from Latin usura, "interest" originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as investment and capital. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. The term is largely derived from Christian religious principles; Riba is the corresponding Arabic term and ribbit is the Hebrew word. The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury (canon 17). At the time, usury was interest of any kind, and the canon merely forbade the clergy to lend money on interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% APR). Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity. The Third Lateran Council decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor Christian burial. Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury a heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation which allowed it. Pope Sixtus V condemned the practice of charging interest as "detestable to God and man, damned by the sacred canons and contrary to Christian charity." All of this however, had absolutely no application to Jews. The Torah makes a distinction between interest deducted before the loan is handed over and interest deducted afterwards. What is clear – as with so much of the Old Testament – is that many prohibitions applied within the Jewish community did not apply outside. In other words, there was a loophole allowing interest to be charged to gentiles. Nonetheless Talmudic Law confined Jewish interest rates to 20%. With the rise of Templar banking and Italian banking who both had comparatively astronomical interest rates (possibly due to the social constrictions which they had found loopholes through) Jewish banking remained extremely popular due to its fairness. As the Jews were ostracized from most professions by local rulers, the church and the guilds, they were pushed into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending. Natural tensions between creditors and debtors were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Precisely in the same way that the aristoricies and European royal families found themselves indebted to the Templars and thereby conspired their demise, so Jews were pushed out of Europe. In 1275, Edward I of England passed the Statute of Jewry which made usury illegal and linked it to blasphemy, in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to the Crown. In 1290, all Jews were expelled from England, and allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown''s. The usury was cited as the official reason for the Edict of Expulsion. The violence targetted at Jews increased in Europe, no doubt encouraged by the indebted aristocracy. In time Italian bankers won the financial war and their way of doing business transformed European commerce, dragging Europe into the Renaissance.',
'The "Constitution for the Jews" was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first bill was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II, intended to protect Jews who suffered during the First Crusade, and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century. The bill forbade, besides other things, Christians from forcing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication. Rather than being specifically targetted at treatment of Jews in Judea, it was more practically focussed on the Jewish communities in Eruope. Jewish merchants and bankers were the lifeblood of European business and ''usury'' or investment banking was reserved solely for Jews. In an attempt to entice more Jews into Europe, with the lure that they were constitutionally protected by religious law- the Pope took this official stance. However as was seen on so many occassions with the terrible violence and blood libels targetted on the Jewish community, this Constitution was in time proven an empty promise.',
'Benedictine refers to the spirituality and consecrated life in accordance with the Rule of St Benedict, written by Benedict of Nursia in the sixth century for the cenobitic communities he founded in central Italy. The most notable of these is Monte Cassino, the first monastery founded by Benedict around 529. Once a postulant has formally entered a monastery he must stay there until he dies. All monks must take turns working in the kitchens and waiting at table. Monks must remain busy, either with manual work, restoring manuscripts or in study and prayer. Monks must remain silent unless they have to speak. The Abbot must be a father to his community. The Abbot must hold meetings with all the monks to decide monastery business. The Abbot''s orders must be obeyed without argument. Every monk must take a vow of chastity. No one should own anything. Monks must pray together seven times a day. At every meal, there must be a reading from the bible. Great care must be taken of those who are sick. The large tracts of land needed to support these communities often meant that the lord who had donated his land to the Order would have to make most use of the rest of his domains by intensifying serfdom and condensing his local population onto smaller patches of land. The poor provincials in the vicinity of the monasteries in any case benefitted from the religous services they performed as wewll as the medical care they offered the communities. The monks also served as clerks and adminstrators for the local landowners and also provided cultural submissions such as art and literature, often focussing on the recording and collection of histories.',
'The word abbot meaning father, is a title given to the head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is Abbess. Monasticism in the West owes its extension and development to Benedict of Nursia (born AD 480). His rule was diffused with miraculous rapidity from the parent foundation on Monte Cassino through the whole of western Europe, and every country witnessed the erection of monasteries far exceeding anything that had yet been seen in spaciousness and splendour. Few great towns in Italy were without their Benedictine convent, and they quickly rose in all the great centres of population in England, France and Spain. The number of these monasteries founded between AD 520 and 700 is amazing. Before the Council of Constance, AD 1415, no fewer than 15,070 abbeys had been established of this order alone. The buildings of a Benedictine abbey were uniformly arranged after one plan, modified where necessary (as at Durham and Worcester, where the monasteries stand close to the steep bank of a river) to accommodate the arrangement to local circumstances. In the high Middle Ages, some abbots even claimed supremacy over bishops an actually took on the mantle of episcopal regalia and insignia. When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop''s diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot''s journey to Rome. ',
'In the heyday of the monastic schools in the 9th and 10th centuries, the teachings of important scholars such as Alcuin, Hrabanus Maurus, Heiric of Auxerre and Notker Balbulus raised the prestige of their abbeys and attracted pupils from afar to attend their courses. Although some monastic schools contributed to the emerging medieval universities, the rise of the universities did not go unchallenged. Some monastic figures such as Bernard of Clairvaux considered the search for knowledge using the techniques of scholasticism to be a challenge to the monastic ideal of simplicity. The rise of medieval universities and scholasticism in the Renaissance of the 12th century offered alternative venues and new learning opportunities to the students and thus led to a gradual decline of the monastic schools.',
'The term Cistercian (French Cistercien), derives from Cistercium, the Latin name for the village of Cîteaux, near Dijon in eastern France. It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded Cîteaux Abbey in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict. The best known of them were Robert of Molesme, Alberic of Citeaux and the English monk Stephen Harding, who were the first three abbots. Bernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order. By the end of the 12th century, the order had spread throughout France and into England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Eastern Europe. The most striking feature of the Order was the return to manual labour, especially field-work, a special characteristic of Cistercian life. Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture. Additionally, in relation to fields such as agriculture, hydraulic engineering and metallurgy, the Cistercians became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. The monasteries despite usually being situated in very inhospitable terrain, were granted better land in time from religious aristocrats. This took land away from the commoners, however their addition to the culture of provincial life and benefits that were arguably worth it.',
'The Mendicant Orders were religious orders which depended directly on the charity of the people for their livelihood. In principle, they rejected owned property, either individually or collectively, believing that this was the most pure way of life to copy followed by Jesus Christ, in order that all their time and energy could be expended on religious work. Since they did not take up massive tracts of farmlands to support themselves they were widely accepted by the local communities they interacted with. They were able to offer medical support and were key members of daily life, officiating birth, marriage and death rites as well as carrying services each week and on all the many Catholic feast days. The Orders included were -Franciscans (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209. Carmelites, (Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206–1214. Dominicans (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215. Servites (Order of Servants of Mary), founded 1233 by the Seven Holy Men of Florence, Italy. Augustinians (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars), founded 1244 - 1256. The Second Council of Lyons (1274) recognized these as the five "great" mendicant orders, and suppressed certain others. The Council of Trent loosened their property restrictions. Afterwards, except for the Franciscans and their offshoot the Capuchins, members of the orders were permitted to own property collectively as do monks. Among other orders are the Trinitarians (Order of the Most Blessed Trinity), founded 1193. Mercedarians (Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy), founded 1218. Minims (Hermits of St. Francis of Paola), founded 1436',

'The Székely (Szeklers) a subgroup of the Hungarian people. Their language is a dialect of Hungarian, and according to their legends they are descended from Attila''s huns who remained in the Carpathian basin following the fall of the Hun empire. All we know for certain is that the Székely greeted the arriving Magyars in 896 with open arms and helped them conquer the Carpathian basin. The Székely nation had collective rights in the middle ages, they were all looked upon as nobles and serfdom was not present amongst themselves. The Székelys did not have to pay taxes (with the exception of the "Cattle tax", which was presented to the royal court when a new king was elected, or when a royal heir was born) but in exchange they had to fufill martial duties, such as guarding the Hungarian frontier, and when duty called, they made up the bulk of the Hungarian vanguard. They were regarded by contemporaries as the finest warriors of Transylvania. Their social hierarchy was also dependant on which part of the armed forces the Székely individual belonged to. The lowest ranking Székelys were the "gyalogok" (foot soldiers) who served as both archers and melee combatants in the Hungarian armies; the middle-class were the "lófők" (horsemen) they served as mounted archers and light cavalry, and at the top of the hierarchy were the "előkelők" (nobles) who could afford the highest quality weapons and armor as well as the finest horses. Interestingly the Székelys and the Magyar populace (including the serfs and commoners) as a whole was not illiterate as most of the population in Europe was: they had a special writing method called the "rovás", which can be compared to the runic writing present in northern Europe, therefore they could both read and write. Historically the Székelys inhabited the border regions of Hungary, Transylvania, and Moldova.',
'Székelyföld (latin:. terra Siculorum eng:. Land of the Szeklers) is the name used for the territory granted by the Hungarian state to be settled by the Szeklers. Settlement of the populace and the division of land was dependent on the ancient Szekler clan system: each member of the Szekler nation was a part of a "nem" or clan, therefore the various "nemek" settled close to each other. The Szeklers were allowed to govern this area in accordance with their ancient laws, as their judicial systems were more or less the same as the Hungarian tribal system used during the Principality period, instead of the new judicial system established to suit the needs of the feudalistic and catholic Kingdom of Hungary. The land itself was divided among the clans, therefore the various clans owned the lands granted to them collectively, therefore if you were a member of a clan, then you could hunt in the forests, fish in the lakes and rivers and graze your cattle freely in the lands owned by your clan without any restrictions that applied to the members of the feudalistic Hungarian state, as usually forests, lakes and rivers were owned either by the King or the nobility. Although this grant of land would allow the Szeklers to start growing crops of their own, the majority of the Szeklers are still practicing pastoralism. Historically Székelyföld was located in south and eastern Transylvania.',
'"A Székely határőrség kialakítása" (English: the organization of the Szekler border guards) is the reinforcement of the forces defending the borders of this province with mounted Székely horse archers called the Lövők (Sharpshooters). The duties of these federal guards included the organization of border patrols, the protection of the royal trade caravans, that transported salt, livestock (such as horses and cattle), iron, gold and silver throughout the Kingdom, as well as the protection of travelers who crossed into Hungary. They also had to report suspicious activity along the border, therefore they acted as messengers and scouts as well. In exchange for these services, the Székely''s did not have to pay taxes (with the exception of the "Cattle tax", which was presented to the royal court when a new king was elected, or when a royal heir was born), and the entire Székely nation were regarded as free men, or nobles. Historically the Szekler border guards proved to be quite effective, they patrolled several key areas including the border with Bohemia, the western border of Hungary with the Holy Roman Empire, as well as guarding the borders of their native Transylvania.',
'The Szeklers of this province are abandoning pastoralism in favor of farming and other settled activities. To understand the importance of this transition from nomadic to the settled way of life, one must examine Székely society prior to the transition. Initially the territory in which the Szeklers would settle was collectively owned by the nation as a whole, with the lands being divided among the various ''nemek'' (clans) who utilized the lands mainly for grazing their animals. Following the settlement of Szekler populations in previously uninhabited areas, or densely forested areas that were deforested to make way for the new communities, the Szeklers slowly started to settle permanently. To support the population boom however, large amounts of food were needed, however animal husbandry did not provide enough, therefore the various communities and clans that lived far apart from each other began to form villages. This meant that the villages could utilize the lands more effectively, if they banded together. This meant that the previous division of land among the clans was broken, and in it''s place the division of land by community began to take form. In essence this meant that the surrounding areas that belonged to the village were now the collective property of the community. To decide who utilized which parts of the land a system called ''nyílvonás'' was established. Using the ancient Szekler runic writing named ''rovás'', the names of the various areas around the system were engraved into arrows, which were placed in a quiver. The various families then proceeded to pull out arrows from the quiver, thus annually the name of the area written on the arrow would be where that individual would be using for a year. These lands were called ''nyílföld'' (arrow lands). The grazing areas were the animals were fed (as breeding livestock was still important) were utilized by the community as a whole, therefore these lands were not divided among the inhabitants.',
'The Szeklers of this province are being granted special rights, to complement their already autonomous laws, collectively called as "Székely jog" or Szekler law. In the history of the Szekler people, laws were extremely important. After settling in an area, Szekler law would be valid in the various settlements, and applied to the Szekler nation as a whole, as well as the individual. Szekler law was defined as the law applicable to all members of the Székely nation. These special rights ensured that any member of the Székely nation could settle anywhere. One of the most important royal rights, granting lands as presents for example were not applicable to Szekler owned lands, therefore the ''Jus regium'' (right of kings) was not applicable to "Székelyföld" (Land of the Szeklers). The law clearly specifies that Székelyföld is owned by the Szeklers, and not the King, although technically the Szekler nation pledged their allegiance to the monarchs of Hungary. This however meant that if Székelyföld is owned by the Szeklers, then the Szeklers themselves could create their own special inheritance laws. ''Inheritance'' in this case means the inheritance of land. Szekler law clearly defines therefore, that a Szekler man cannot lose his inheritance (to the King), even if he is charged with treason: in such cases his lands are granted to his brother. The same is applicable to a family: if the last member of the family dies, the lands are not taken by the King, but instead they are granted to the nearest relatives. Different, local versions of Szekler law was also established in the various settlements throughout Székelyföld, however these changes were small and usually specified how judicial cases were settled in the village, these were called "a falu törvénye" (laws of the village). Historically, the first mentioning of Szekler law was in 1272.',
'Kollektív birtokadományok'' or collective grants of land are being issued to the Szeklers of this province by the Hungarian state. According to Szekler law each member of the Szekler nation is a freeman, their property could not be confiscated, and everyone was regarded as an equal: effectively this is the definition of collective nobility. However, they did not have the right of "jus proprietatis" or ''right of property'': the lands owned by the Szekler nation were owned by the community as a whole, with lands being granted for farming to the members of the community which could not be sold. Over time however, previously forested or unusable areas were utilized by certain members of the community, who farmed these areas without dividing the land among his fellow community members. Other Szeklers were granted lands for their military bravado by the state, and these lands were also regarded as private property by those who received such gifts, whilst others simply bought lands, which led to the rise of a new magnate class within the Szekler society, an oligarch of landowners who became increasingly rich by gaining lands due to such practices. To subdue to conflict therefore between those who gained new lands and those who equally divide their lands in the community, collective grants of land are being issued by the Hungarian state. With new lands being utilized by the Szeklers, their population increases, and the new lands provide new lands for grazing livestock and for growing crops with leads to an agricultural boom in this province.',
'The Comitatus Siculorum (english: Székely Earldom) is the reformation of the old Székely tribal system. Previously, the Székely''s in this province were led by the tribal leaders and the heads of the largest clans: however, with this reform, the King delegates a Székely Ispán (earl) to organize and coordinate the Székely forces of this province. The Ispán is hand-picked by the King himself, and is not of Székely origin. The duties of the Ispán include the organization of the Székely diets, the settling of disputes, and acting as the chief judicial authority of the Székely''s in this province. In wartime, he leads the Székely forces of the province in battle. His administrative duties also include choosing the Székely judges (that act as regional dispute handlers in Székely territory) , the collection of fines, the tariffs collected by the Székely border guards and the handling of all royal estates locating within Székely territory. Historically there was only one Székely Ispánság, headed by the Székely Ispán, and his seat of power was located at Székelyudvarhely in Székelyföld, Transylvania.',
'The establishment of a permanent forum for discussion regarding internal matters in the Székely holds leads to the establishment of the "Székely nemzetgyűlés" (literally: gathering of the Szekler nation) or Szekler diet. Following it''s establishment, the Székely nemzetgyűlés becomes the chief legislative body within the Szekler lands. The diet was an important piece in the autonomy of the lands owned by the Szeklers. It''s legislative and judicial powers exceeded royal authority, therefore fundamental laws enacted elsewhere in the Kingdom could be ignored, new laws could be enacted and judicial penalties such as the confiscation of goods (livestock for example) could be imposed by the diet (a power that the King did not have, due to the Szekler laws) on certain individuals. The diet is headed by the Székely Ispán, who calls together the diet when a high enough percentage of Szekler representatives request it. Historically we have a first hand account regarding one of these meetings thanks to Verancsics, the Bishop of Erdőelve (Transylvania). He writes the following: ''they arrive to the gathering with arms, and the key people attending the summit sit in a circle, whilst the other members of the gathering [others being hierarchically lower ranking Szeklers] stand. They shout vigorously and loudly if they oppose a bill, creating much noise to avoid the acceptance of such laws [that they deem unacceptable]. Those who propose and carry through laws that they [the lower ranking Szeklers] oppose, such as the enactment of a tax or something alien to the Szeklers have to suffer the vengeance of them, as they destroy their houses [This does not mean that in the process the target is killed, but rather he has to rebuild his house], however those who dare curtail the freedoms of the Szeklers by enacting a law are chased down by them, and if they are captured, they are executed in front of the nemzetgyűlés''.',
'An administrative reform is being instituted in this province, which will lead to the establishment of the ''Székely székek'' or Szekler seats, which are special autonomous administrative counties populated exclusively by Székely people. The reform grants legislative and judicial autonomy to the Szeklers themselves. The new division means that the various ''Székek'' divide the Székelyföld (Szeklerland), with with the Széks making up the Comitatus or Ispánság, led by the Székelyek Ispánja (latin:. comes Siculorum eng:. Earl of the Szeklers). The military duties of the Szék''s were organized by the "Szék Kapitányok", or captains of the Széks. Their duties included the organization of the military forces provided by the Széks, checking their equipment and creating a census of those men eligible for military service. The judicial cases were debated in the "Székgyűlés" or gathering of the seats, (hence why these counties were called seats) organized within a Szék. The members of these gatherings were: the Captain of the Szék, the Székbíró (the sheriff of the Szék), the Királybíró (A royally appointed sheriff) and twelve members who made up the jury. The Széks also took part in the political matters of their province, as they sent members to the annual diets.',
'This building marks the invitation and settlement of the"segédnépek" (allied tribes) in this province. The "Katonai segédnépek" was the collective name for the various auxiliary forces made up out of the various ethnic groups that joined the Magyar tribes before (the Kabars, the Böszörmény and the Káliz) during (Slavs) and after (the Becsenek [English: Pechenegs]) the conquest of the Carpathian basin. These various nationalities were usually settled in previously uninhabited areas within the province, with each ethnic group being granted their own territory. The Hungarian state counted upon these people to increase the size of the Hungarian armed forces. As it was customary along the steppe, the newest arrivals made up the vanguard of the Hungarian forces. Regarding the religious division of these various peoples, the Böszörmény and the Káliz were muslims. Most of the Becsenek were pagan, however the Kangars a subgroup of the Pechenegs were nestorian christians who were regarded as heretics by the Hungarian catholic church.',
'Out of those people who arrived from the steppe to settle in Hungarian territories, the Kunok (Cumans) and the Jászok (Alans) were the most numerous. These peoples, who were predominantly nomads, consisting of many tribes and ethnicities were referred to as Cumans - even though the term "Cuman" most likely meant the strongest tribe that constituted only a fraction of the tribal alliance. In exchange for being granted settling rights within this province, the Cumans and the Alans provide fearsome light cavalry and mounted archer auxiliary troops for the Hungarian state. Religiously, both the Cumans and the Alans were pagans and due to the cultural differences, they are bound to cause unrest within the province, due to their various freedoms. Historically, the Cuman and Alan tribes were at war with Hungary, and several invasion attempts by them were fended off by the Hungarian state. Following their defeat at the hands of the Mongols, they requested asylum in Hungary in exchange for providing military aid against the Mongols, and settling rights within Hungary proper.',
'The "Nemzetiségi ispánságok" or ethnic earldoms is an administrative region within this province. These groups, which had been settled in regions owned by the monarch had no definitive leader, as they were broken up into clans and tribes. Therefore to settle the various disputes between the clans and tribes, as well as to have a military leader that would lead them in war, the position of Ispán (earl) was established for all the ethnic groups. The Ispán in this case was not a member of the people''s he had been appointed to govern, therefore the "Besenyők Ispánja" or Earl of the Pechenegs would not have been a Pecheneg himself. Since these peoples provided military forces in exchange for exemption from taxes and tariffs, the Ispán had two duties: he lorded over the various judicial cases, and he led them in battle. These Ispánságok (Earldoms) were usually in deserted areas or on the border, therefore the inhabitants had nothing to do but follow the nomadic way of life instead of settling. Historically, the first documented that mentions an ethnic Ispán, the Ispán of the Pechenegs in the Hanság area is dated to 1222.',
'The creation of special "Nemzetiségi szabadságjogok" or ethnic freedoms is the institution of granting special rights to the various steppe groups inhabiting this province. The most important right granted to them is their autonomy judicially. Instead of presenting their cases to the regional state authority, they could settle their smaller issues internally, whilst the important issues would be settled by the Nádor (count-palatine of Hungary). They were also allowed to keep their social hierarchical system in place. First of all, everyone belonged to a certain "törzs" or tribe, and within that a "nemzetség" or clan. The leader of these clans were the "nemzetségfő" or clan chiefs. The clan leaders were the chief military commanders of the clan''s forces, as well as all judicial cases occurring within the clan had to be brought to them. The middle-class was made up out of the nobles (nobiles) who had the same rights as any Hungarian noble (Szerviens). During war-time they gathered and fought under the banner of the clan chief. These men made up the "nyögérek" or "nögerek" who were the guards of the clan leader. The lower-classes were made up out of poor, however freemen, who became the serfs of these peoples. There were also a large amount of slaves who were either poor commoners who became slaves to pay off their debts or prisoners of war. In exchange for the special rights of the various ethnic groups, the royal decree freed these members, who could return to their families. Historically, the Cumans received such rights in 1279 from King Ladislaus IV nicknamed the "Cuman" as his mother was of Cuman descent.',
'"Kollektív földadományok" or collective grants of land are being issued to the various ethnic groups within this province. The various ethnic groups that served the Hungarian state as border guards and provided auxiliary forces for the Hungarian military were mostly nomads. Having being granted lands in uninhabited or sparsely inhabited areas belonging to the King, they began to overpopulate these areas, as well as their animals began to graze other areas that didn''t belong to them. The reports of livestock grazing on privately owned lands, and the "stealing of brides" occurring throughout the Kingdom (which was a common steppe custom, where the chosen bride had to be "liberated" against her will from her family) will surely lead to ethnic conflicts within the province. To settle these issues, collective grants of lands are being issued to these ethnic groups, in order to settle these people, and to promote the settled way of live, instead of pastoralism. Therefore these groups are granted large portions of lands where their clans and tribes are settled in different areas, to avoid clan and tribal disputes. The ruling class however is settled near the capital, and they are granted an active role in the shaping of policy within the province.',
'"Kollektív nemesség" or the collective grants of nobility to all members of the various ethnic groups settled here by the Hungarian state is being instituted in this province. The collective grant of nobility to a group in feudalism meant that although the various members of did not reach the rank of noble in the social hierarchy individually (most importantly the rights of a freeman), but in exchange for certain duties (such as providing auxiliary forces in wartime) or for settling in a specific region (such as a border region to guard the border of the province) they were granted rights akin to that of nobility. Historically, within the Hungarian state collective grants of nobility were issued to the various ethnic groups who settled along the border regions to protect Hungary from external attacks. The most note able grous are the Kunok (Cumans), the Jászok (Alans), the Székelyek (Szeklers) and the Gömöri lándzsásnemesek (heavy infantry regiments from Gömör county) who were most likely Kabars.',
'The organization of " Nemzetiségi székek" or Ethnic Seats is being instituted within this province. The "Seats" were special autonomous regions within the Hungarian state. These counties acted as separate municipalities, governed by the local elite. Each of these nationalities are granted their own "Széks", with the Széks making up the Comitatus or Ispánság, led by the Ispán (Earl) who was the highest ranking member of the ethnic group. The military duties of the Szék''s were organized by the "Szék Kapitányok", or captains of the Széks. Their duties included the organization of the military forces provided by the Széks, checking their equipment and creating a census of those men eligible for military service. The judicial cases were debated in the "Székgyűlés" or gathering of the seats, (hence why these counties were called seats) organized within a Szék. The members of these gatherings were: the Captain of the Szék, the Székbíró (the sheriff of the Szék), the Királybíró (a royally appointed sheriff) and twelve members who made up the jury. The Széks also took part in the political matters of their province, as they sent members to the annual diets. Historically the Kunok (Cumans) and the Jászok (Alans) managed to organize such administrative counties in the 15th century, as by this time the other ethnic groups such as the Pechenegs and the Kabars became magyarized, and they lost their own cultural and lingual identity. The abandonment of the nomadic lifestyle, and the adoption of the settled lifestyle brought great changes to the Cumans. Their gradually began to adopt feudalism within their holds, and the social classes that were designated by who belonged to which clan changed to who was in favor of the King, and who wasn''t. The Cumans, who arrived to Hungary as freemen did not want to become serfs, therefore the poorer class of Cumans began to leave their masters, which lead to the depopulation of several Cuman seats. With depopulation becoming a grave issue, the Cuman nobility began to invite serfs from other regions to settle in the Cuman territories, which led to the magyarization of the populace. With paganism being suppressed and the change in lifestyle that made the Cumans and the Alans who they were, they became part of the Hungarian state, with only their names showing who their proud ancestors were.',
'"A nemzetiségek erőszakos térítése" or the forced christianization of the populace by the state is a policy being adopted in this province. The various ethnic groups that were invited to settle within this province are causing major unrest. Although formally they have accepted the state religion of Catholicism, they continue to pursue their past religions, which is decreasing the effectiveness of the policy of supporting the spread of christianity within this province. This legislation bans and commands the following things: 1. Participating in any religious activities other than Catholicism 2. The acceptance of Christianity as the sole religion 3. The abandonment of the nomadic way of life 4. The abandonment of living in tents and the erection of permanent housing, as well as the building of Churches 5. The acceptance of the virtues of Christianity, which must be accepted by their servants as well 6. They have to return all stolen items from the Church and the State. This policy is the first step towards the assimilation of these peoples. By losing their cultural identity, they loose the various bonuses that their uniqueness provides to the Hungarian state such as special ethnic regiments, in exchange for the increase in law and order within this province. Historically, the Cumans were forced to adopt Christianity, as they only embraced Christianity formally, and they continued their Pagan lifestyle in Hungary.',
'A policy called "A nemzetiségek beolvasztása" or the assimilation of the various invited ethnic groups is being instituted in this province. Following the christianization of the populace, the next step in assimilating these peoples is the establishment of feudalism. The various peoples that settled within this province have previously had their own tribal system based on clans (nemzetségek), where every member of the society was regarded as a freeman, which the ruling elite being the leaders of the various clans. To establish feudalism, the leaders of the clans are elevated to the rank of noble within the state, therefore they become the equals of the Hungarian ruling elite, in exchange for forcing their own people to settle, to promote agriculturalism instead of pastoralism which would aid the adoption of serfdom. To promote integration, the ruling Hungarian elite and the Cuman elite are encouraged to intermingle by state supported mass weddings. With the dissolution of the tribal and clan system based on blood and relatives, and the adoption of Christianity and serfdom, the last remaining step was the revoking of previously special rights and the revoking of tax and tariff exemption rights. By losing their special rights, embracing Christianity, and the various systems of serfdom they will gradually lose their cultural uniqueness, and even their language through time. Naturally such a transition shan''t be without bloodshed, and there will be some who resist, therefore this process does take quite some time. The Magyarization of these peoples is complete, they are now part of the Hungarian social hierarchical system. Historically the integration of the Cumans lasted for several centuries in the same way that was explained above. Due to extensive wars with the Ottoman Empire, and the loss of life resulting from that, a large percent of foreign settlers started to migrate to the uninhabited Cuman areas, which sped up the integration process. Today nobody speaks Cuman, and the Cumans consider themselves a subgroup of the Magyar people.',
'The policy of "Exclusio Hospites" is being instituted within this province. The words themselves mean "the exclusion of foreign guests". The Hungarian state stands at a crossroad regarding immigration policy within this province: should the state support the settlement of foreign, mostly western nobles or Hungarian nobles to form the new ruling elite within this province? Although supporting the western immigrants would result in the province being able to provide the Hungarian state with formidable heavy cavalry regiments as well as boosting the economy quickly via the spread of western agricultural, mining and other economic technologies, on the other side the Hungarian nobility would think that the would be left out of the loop, and this could result in severe consequences such as a revolt which would allow the native classes to fight out their independence. Therefore this policy insures that the fiefs and territories claimed by the state are issued to the Hungarian noble class, which will form the new ruling elite within the province. This means that the economy will begin a steady growth under the hands of the Hungarian nobles, and they will provide traditional Hungarian regiments instead of western heavy cavalry regiments for the state. Historically the Hungarian nobility was always on alert against foreign nobles gaining too much power in Hungary, and if needed they would rebel against even the monarch to ensure their rights within the state. Perhaps the most iconic example of such practices by the Hungarian nobility is the assassination of Gertrudis, the wife of András II of Hungary. Due to Gertrudis being a German princess, she favored her own kinsmen which led to the immigration of a large amount of ethnically German nobles into Hungary, who began to form the ruling class in Hungary. The Hungarian nobles, who saw that they were being pushed out of power decided to act. During a campaign against Halych led by the King himself, they organized a royal hunt during which they assassinated the queen in the forest of Pilis.',
'The "Saxones" or Szászok is the collective name for the predominantly German speaking settlers that have arrived as immigrants to populate this province. These immigrants are mainly from overpopulated areas all throughout western Europe. The areas they are being settled in are mainly densely forested areas and uninhabited areas that the immigrants will cut down to make way for cities, villages and fields for plowing. The areas they were settled in were lands owned by the King himself. The ever increasing need for crafted goods, expertise in construction of both fortifications and civilian buildings as well as an able and experienced workforce to boost the agricultural and mining capabilities of the region, as well as providing auxiliary forces for the Hungarian state made the settlers in the eyes of the Hungarian monarchs quite valuable. Their territorial division was made up out of a "Bauernlehen" or "Peasant fiefs", in which they had special judicial rights (such as settling disputes internally), although in administrative cases they had to appeal to the Ispán (Earl) who controlled the county they were settled in.',
'The "Hospes" (guests) were initially immigrants from western countries, mainly nobles and knights, who left their homeland due to overpopulation, wanderlust or political reasons, and in some cases they were invited by the royal court. These immigrants were from northern Italy and western Europe, mainly from Bavaria and Swabia. There were also massive populations of Englishmen after the defeat at Hastings and the dispossession of Anglo-Saxon gentry by Norman lords. In the royal court they were welcomed, and in exchange for military service they were granted lands, (usually in sparsely inhabited, or completely uninhabited regions) and special rights. Historically, the first wave of immigrants arrived en mass during the time of King István I (1000-1038). Most of the new arrivals were knights, who served as heavy cavalrymen in the early period, or became clergymen, and some of them became high ranking nobles within the Kingdom, following a civil war which resulted in the change of the ruling class from tribal leaders to western minded nobles who supported the King and the policy of christianisation.',
'The "Hospites Flandrenses" or Flemish guests was the name the native Hungarian population gave to the new settlers who were invited by the Kings of Hungary to settle in previously uninhabited lands called "deserta" within the province. Although the name suggests that they were from Flanders and Wallonia , most of the settlers were from the Mosel-Rhein river regions, and other areas in western Europe, although Flemish people can be found among them as well. Due to their knowledge of new western European agricultural, crafting and mining technologies these new arrivals were welcomed with open arms by the monarchs of Hungary. These immigrants were granted special rights, including exceptions from tariffs, the right to hold markets in their towns, and they did not have to take up arms when Hungary was at war. In exchange for this, the settlers paid special taxes. Many of these settlers settled in large cities and trading hubs, where they became administrators, scribes, and craftsmen (for example blacksmiths). Historically, the first colonists arrived en mass in 1150 during the reign of King Géza II who settled them mainly on the border regions of Hungary which were sparsely or completely uninhabited.',
'The Királyfölde (latin: Fundus Regius, english: Land of the King) were large regions within provinces owned exclusively by the King, where the Szász (or Saxon) immigrants were settled. These areas, which were sparsely or completely uninhabited, had dense forests, untouched mineral veins, and unused lakes and rivers: thus providing an incredibely abundant place to live for the colonists. The immigrants, who were collectively referred to as "Szászok" (Saxons) were German speaking people from Saxony, Bavaria, Swabia, Flanders and Walloonia. Due to western advancements in mining, agricultural, craftsmanship, and the fighting style of the German knights, they were highly valued and welcomed by the monarchs of Hungary. In exchange for improving agriculture and viticulture in the province, introducing new mining techniques and fighting in the Hungarian armies as either armored Knights or heavy infantry, they were granted special rights. Historically, "Fundus Regius" was located in southern Transylvania, which was settled by Székelys (Szeklers) who served as border guards in the area. After being settled there, the Székelys were moved eastward, and that region of Transylvania was from there on known as "Szászföld", land of Saxons.',
'Altland meaning "old land" refers to the area settled by the Saxons first in a province. After populating the previously uninhabited territory owned by the King called "Fundus Regius", the Saxons would start to branch out, and request special rights and autonomy on their lands from the monarchs of Hungary. The first rights granted to the Saxons were the following: they could use the royal forests for hunting and fish in the royal rivers and lakes, they did not have to pay tariffs on their goods, they could pay their taxes in one sum at the start of each year (this was important as if the value of the Hungarian currency would fall, they would have to pay more), they could choose their own clergymen, and their religious institutions answering directly to the Archbishop of Esztergom, instead of a regional figure which granted them additional religious autonomy. During this time, two distinct classes would emerge from the Saxons: the "Gerébek", who served as Knights within the armies of Hungary, and the Commoners. However they were not serfs, as both the Geréb and the Commoners had to pay taxes, therefore serfdom was not adopted amongst the Saxons: everyone was regarded as equal. Historically Altland was centered around the city of Szeben, in southern Transylvania.',
'The Diploma Saxonum grants provisional autonomy to the colonial Germand and other western immigrants known as "Szászok" (Saxons) residing within this province. The Saxons who were mainly built up out of Flemish, Walloon, Swabian, Saxon and Bavarian colonists from the west (incorrectly called by the natives as "Szászok"). This charter provides special rights for the Saxons including choosing their own Chief-Justice who was second to only the King, also Saxon lands could not be given away, and the regional justices and priests could also be chosen by the Saxons themselves. In exchange for this, the Saxons paid special taxes and during conflicts, they had to provide the King with Saxon forces. Historically, The Diploma Andreanum, or Goldener Freibrief der Sachsen Siebenbürger (English: Golden Charter of Transylvanian Saxons) was issued by Hungarian monarch András II in 1224.',
'The "Sedes Saxonum" (Királyi Szász Székek or Royal Saxon counties) are special administrative units within the Kingdom of Hungary, inhabited by the "Szász" (or Saxons) a German speaking ethnic minority, with special rights, granted by the King''s diploma. The Saxons, who were built up out of western colonists ranging from Anglo-Saxons, to Walloons and Flemish peole, as well as immigrants from the Holy Roman Empire inhabited an area owned by the Royal Crown called Fundus Regius (The Land of the King) sought additional protection and autonomy within the province. The meaning of "Szék" literally means "seat", which alludes to the fact that these counties were centered around a city were the leader of the province, the Királybíró (Justice of the King) had his "seat of power". The Királybíró attends and heads the "Székgyűlés" (Literally gathering of Chairs), where the annually chosen 12 members of the various guilds, village elders, and other Saxon communities came to talk about matters concerning their hold. Historically the first Royal Saxon County, Szászsebesszék was established in Transylvania, 1303 A.D. There were eight different "Szék''s". Kőhalomszék, Nagysinkszék, Segesvárszék, Szászsebesszék, Szászvárosszék, Szebenszék, Szerdahelyszék, Újegyházszék.',
'Unio Trium Nationum (Latin for Union of the Three Nations) was a pact of mutual aid formed by the three Estates of Transylvania: the Hungarian nobility, the Saxon burghers, and the free Szeklers. Following the increase of the discontent due to tax increases and extensive wars among the Serfs, the Union ensured that the serfs continued to be excluded from the political and social life of Transylvania, although they made up the majority of the population in the Noble Counties (Comitates). Historically the Union was established on February 2, 1438. The alliance of the three privileged estates continued to be effective for many centuries and provided the framework of the internal politics in Transylvania.',
'The "Gyepűrendszer" or Fallow lands, originally conceived by Magyar tribes as outlands beyond the settlements was used for grazing their horses and acting as a form of open buffer zone against foreign states. The Gyepű was a strip of land that was specially fortified or made impassable, while the Gyepűelve was the mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited land beyond it. The only way foreign travelers could enter through the gyepű and make it out alive (as tresspassers would be hunted down) was through the "Kapuk" (literally gates). In mountainious regions, there was no need for an artifical gyepű, but the Kapuk were fortified to withstand enemy forces for quite a while. These were the only routes were traders and foreigners could pass through (as they had to pay tariffs here). The Kapuk could be "closed" at any time by obstructing the way (with logs or stones), which would buy the defenders enough time to mount a counter-attack during an invasion. These technically belonged to the King, and as the need for grazing lands by settled urbanised Magyars declined these lands could be given to foreign peoples who would populate the vast expanses, they would act as federal guards similar to the tradition of Roman resettlement. The main ethnic groups guarding the borders were: the Kabars [Khazars], the Szeklers [Huns], and the Becsenek [The Pechenegs]. Historically the gyepű system was quite effective, as several invasion attempts were thwarted thanks to the gyepű, as the defenders could marshall enough forces and hit the enemy in foreign territory with little to no manueverability within the gyepű. After a time, due to overpopulation, the gyepű territories were converted to accomodate inhabitants, but the peoples who settled at the edges of the Hungarian state still needed to be on alert, and were usually transplanted there to act as border guards.',
'The reorganization of the administrative division of this province is being instituted. The new system that will be instituted is called the "Várispánság" (Castle-Earldoms) reform. This does not mean the immediate abolishment of the gyepű system however, as the new administrative division will only supplement and increase the effectiveness of the fortifications in this province to defend the border and the heartland. The new reform redistributes the lands as well, placing all fortifications into the hands of the King. The province itself is broken up into small regions called Várispánságok (Castle-Earldoms) where the largest fortification acts as the cultural, administrative and military center for the region. This is where the "Várispán" places his seat of power. These men are directly picked by the monarch himself, and serve as the administrator, chief justice of the region, and during wartime the commander-in-chief of the earldoms forces. The three distinct social classes within the earldoms are: the "Tisztségviselők", who are made up out of low ranking nobles (servients) and clergymen. These men make up the court of the Várispán. The "Katonatisztek" (Officers) or "Várjobbágyok" serve as Castellans (Várnagyok) for the smaller fortifications, guard captains (Őrnagyok). The last social class is made up out of the "Várnépek" or Castle-serfs. Although they were technically "freemen", and they had special rights, during sieges they made up the forces defending the fortifications, and during peacetime they provided the castle grounds with supplies. In spite of the fact they were not regarded as serfs, however they were indefinitely tied to their fortification, as they could not relocate to another area.',
'The Határvármegye system (latin: Marchia english: border counties) were special administrative counties within the Kingdom tasked with guarding the border regions of Hungary. Traditionally the Hungarian border was defended by the "Gyepű" or fallow lands, which were naturally and artifically fortified uninhabited or sparsely inhabited regions at the very edge of the province, which acted as a buffer zone between Hungary and foreign states. This system was supplemented with the Várispánság (castle-earldom) reform, which introduced special castle-earldoms that could were tasked with defending specific regions, thus enchancing the defense capabilities of the province. The Hatávármegye reform introduces the construction of large fortifications and border posts along the gyepű to slow down enemy incursions, and to defend the border more effectively. These border fortifications were usually made from wood and stone and in some cases they were earthen fortifications. Each of these border counties were headed by a Határispán (Earl of the borderlands). Any foreigner that wished to pass through the gyepű had to enter through one of the "Kapuk" (Gates) which were during the "gyepű" period simply fortified mountain passes and valley exits, whilst under the Határvármegye reform, fortifications were constructed to fortify these gates, which enacted as tariff collector posts for any merchants wishing to pass through Hungary. The inhabitants of these counties were mostly the families of the border guards (gyepűőrök), who were mainly built up out of the Székelys (Szeklers), Kavars, and the Becsenek (Pechenegs). These guards were called the "Lövők" (sharpshooters) and the "Királyi Vitézek" (royal horse archers), who manned these border outposts and fortifications, and organized patrols along the border. The leader of the fortifications, and the men tasked with defending the various fortifications themselves was the "Őrnagy" (literally Great Guard) . Historically, the border counties we know of were located at the northern, western and southern regions of Hungary proper.',
'The "Végvár" or Citadel reform is a martial reform that adovcated the construction of new fortifications, the improvement of the already existing fortifications, and revised the duties of the men serving in the various fortifications scattered along the border and throughout the province. Since the appearance of gunpowder made the iconic extremely tall, yet thin walls of the Hungarians obsolete, the reform commanded the destruction of all stone walls and in their place stronger, thicker walls were added with artillery support. Previously, in times of crisis the populace inhabiting the area in the vicinity of a fortification fled to the nearest fortification, where they would shelter themselves in the castle stores, catacombs, and other defended of subterran areas within the castle grounds. The need however for levies and the extra manpower to defend the ramparts resulted in the arming of these civilians during sieges, for which the reform provides adaquate weapons and armor. The duties of the permanent guards of the fortifications also changed: when a large enemy host would approach a fortification, the inhabitants would prepare for the siege and dig themselves in - if the fortification would be deemed unimportant or time consuming with little gain, the enemy forces would proceed onward, leaving their supply trains open for attack: thus the men of these fortifications were tasked with disrupting the logistics of the enemy forces. The defense of the supply lines proved essential in certain campaigns, therefore the enemy forces were keen on taking these fortifications one by one. This system proved to be quite useful, as akin to the gyepű of old, a long siege would allow a counter-attack to be formed against the invaders. During peacetime and offensives however, the federal guards would be tasked with preforming "portyák" or raids. These raids, usually aimed at crippling the enemy supply lines, the liberation of prisoners taken from Hungary and the harassment of the border patrols of the enemy forces. These defensive measures would delay enemy invasions, keep enemy forces always on high alert, and provided loot for the victors. Historically this system was established during the Ottoman invasion period, and proved to be quite effective.',
'"A Bánságok kialakítása" (the creation of the Banates) is an administrative reform being enacted within this province. The "Bánságok" or Banates were special autonomous provinces headed by the "Bán" or Ban. The Bán''s answered directly to the King, therefore they were in essence monarchs in their own land. The title of Ban however could be revoked at any time, and usually it did not last a lifetime for the bearer of the title. The various Ispáns (Earls) answered directly to him ,instead of the King, and in judicial cases they had to represent their cases to the Bans, as they would to the King or the Nádor (Count Palatine of Hungary). The Bán''s also had authority to gather their own forces in times of danger without approval from the King. The Banates were usually located in provinces close to the military frontier of Hungary, and were important as the local populace provided forces to defend these contested regions from incursions into the Hungarian home provinces. Historically the Bánságok were established at the southern fronter of Hungary in Croatia and Slavonia. The Voivodes can also be considered Bán''s therefore the Voivodships of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldova also fall into this category.',
'The "Királyi vármegye" (royal county) reform is an administrative reform that changes several aspects in the governence of this province. First of all, the division of land is restructurized. One third of the land is divded amongst the Hungarian ruling class, and royal family members.  Out of the remaining two thirds of the land, a small portion is relegated to the clergy, and another small portion isreserved for royal hunting grounds and estates for the monarch, with the remainder constituting the "Vármegyék" (counties).  In Hungarian, vármegye literally means "castle-county", as the centers of these administrative units were usually the largest fortification in the region.  These counties, which were headed by an Ispán (Earl).  Since they were hand-picked by the King from the local nobility, and the nomination did not last for a lifetime, the entire province becomes dependant on the King, which leads to the centralization of power. The duties of an Ispán include collecting taxes,overlording the judicial cases within the county as well as being the commander-in-chief of the county''s forces during war. The annual income (gained from taxation, tariffs and mining, farming exct) of the province was split in the following way: the King recieved two thirds of the profits, whilst the Ispán recieved the other third, which meant that the Ispán had to administrate the province effecitvely to generate more income. Historically, the Vármegye system was established under the reign of King Stehen I of Hungary during the10th century. Intially there were 48 counties, but later on they became morenumerous. Since these counties would place all power in the hands of the King, they would result in a strong, centralized state. This division would continue to persist with little to no changes until the 13th century.',
'This administrative reform grants special rights for the "Szerviensi közösségek" or Servient communities. The word "Szerviens" means ''Servant of the King''. These men were nobles and freemen who did have lands of their own and a few serfs which placed them above the serfs in the social hierarchy, however the size of their lands (which were quite small) prevented them from joining the ruling elite. Following the reformation of the administration in this province via the "Királyi Vármegye" (Royal county) reform, many of these impoverished nobles and freemen lost their lands, and they therefore flocked to the nearest high ranking noble who could grant them land, thus they began to fortify the position of several nobles which became oligarchs via possessing large quantities of land that only they could own. Therefore this reform insures special rights for these communities to make this social class more loyal to the state itself instead of regional landowners. Their special rights are the following: they do not have to pay royal taxes, as well as they are exempt from paying the special freeman tax (szabadok dénárjai). They are granted their own lands, which their descendants can inherit, however if the individual does not have any heirs, the lands are taken by the King following his demise. Judicially they had to present their cases to the King himself, not the regional authority. In exchange for this, they had to provide the state with military forces, that were under the direct control of the King, instead of a regional authority such as the Ispán, thus this reform leads to the strengthening of the state power in this province. Historically this group is first mentioned in 1217. The ''Golden Bull of András II'' (instituted in 1224) which is regarded as the Magna Charta of Hungary designated eleven passages (out of 31) specifically to the Servients, which meant they were a power to be reckoned with, as the Golden Bull was forced on the King (due to internal unrest amongst the emerging gentry). Although these various freedoms did decrease unrest, and led to the strengthening of the state instead of regional landlords, the model of the Királyi Vármegye which centralized all power with the exception of a few chosen earls (the Ispán''s who led the various counties) was broken, and this reform began the road that increased the participation of the emerging gentry class (köznemesség) into the internal politics of the various provinces.',
'The "Nemesi vármegye" (nobiliary county) is an administrative reform being instituted in this province. With the strengthening of the gentry in Hungary following the rights granted to the Szerviensek (low ranking nobles serving in the Hungarian military directly under the King in exchange for special rights and lands granted by the King) the administration of the "Királyi Vármegyék" (royal counties) began to transform. The gentry, which had become a serious force to reckon with, (as they provided the backbone of the King''s military forces) began to ask for positions of power within their home province, so they could participate in policy making within their home regions. Although the Ispán (Earl), the leader of the Vármegye was still chosen by the King himself, the Alispán (his deputy) was chosen by the gentry. They could also choose their "Szolgabíró" (Sheriff), who lorded over the various disputes between the gentry. Each county had four sheriffs. The gentry could also choose their representatives in the diet. The participation of the gentry in the internal affairs of the county resulted in the rise of the gentry class in Hungary. The compromise between the monarch and the gentry in allowing them to take a more active role within their home province led to the increase of the standard of living as well as the prosperity of the province, since they would become more interested in increasing the competitiveness of their region. Historically, as far as we know the creation of the nobiliary county started in 1232, and by 1267 several nobiliary counties were in existence.',
'A large scale administrative reform (Közigazgatási reform) is being instituted in this province. Firstly, a new taxation reform was introduced. Due to the increasing gap between the lower classes (where some serfs were rich enough to lease lands from a noblemen, whilst others had just enough land to sustain their family and pay taxes) the "Kapu-adó" or Gate tax was instituted. The Gate tax was collected from the peasantry after every gate, where a cart could go through, due to the fact that only the richer peasants owned carts of their own. A new customs system is also instituted called Tricesima (Harmincadvám). The tariff was 1/30 of all foreign commercial affairs. Due to the law prohibiting mines being owned by the nobility, the richer landowners operated mines in secret. To avoid such practices,a reform called the Urbura (Bányabér) was established. The opening of mines by the nobility was legalized in exchange for providing two thirds of the metal to the King. This was supplemented with the prohibition of minting by the nobility, which meant the metal had to be sold at ore price, or in a smelted form, as the nobility could not mint coins of their own from the precious metals. The reform also approved urbanization, by making all prominent cities "Szabad királyi városok" (royal free cities). This meant that these cities were removed from the county system, and were governed by the citizenry itself instead of the regional nobility. Urbanization and migrating to these cities were promoted by granting the citizen rank in exchange for settling in the city. They could also choose their own clergymen, hold fairs and shape their own internal affairs. In exchange for this, they had to pay an annual tax to the King. With the rise of the citizen class, guilds began to emerge to increase the quality of the manufactured goods within the city. Historically the reform described above was instituted by Charles I of Hungary, who is regarded as one of the greatest monarchs in Hungary. Charles arrived to Hungary during a period of interregnum after the last of the Árpád-dynasty Kings had died (1301). Although he was from the Angevin dynasty, and he did not speak Hungarian when he arrived, he became one of the greatest monarchs in Hungary, as well as Europe. During his reign, Hungary became one of the strongest states in Europe, and the richest in all of Europe. The gold production of the mines reached the figure of 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) of gold annually – one third of the total production of the world as then known, and five times as much as that of any other European state. The currency of the Hungarian state at the time, the Golden Florin (Arany forint) was the most sought currency in all of Europe.',

'A Hansa Kontor, was simply an administrative office for the clerks, merchants and officers of trade to conduct business. The sheer organisational abilities of the Hansa meant that such an office in a foreign port was a powerful –and wealthy- force. In many ways a Kontor could spread through a city making a small city district and naturally begun to upset the local merchants because they aggressively outsourced them.',
'A Hansa city was an official recognition, usually by the Imperial forces that had now come to use the Hansa as a colonising force. The establishment of a Hansa City brought with it extensive security measures to ensure safe passage of shipping and trade over land as well. It allowed trade to be conducted in a much more organised manner which in turn was much more efficient at harvesting tax revenue for the local lords and the king.',
'The trade between the merchant associations of Hamburg and Luebeck provided a model for the merchant associations of the other North German cities to follow. In 1201 Cologne, already wealthy, joined the league. Danzig, whose port was a gateway to the eastern Baltic also joined as did most of the important Baltic port cities. By the height of the Hansa''s power merchants from over sixty cities had joined the association. While each city had its own merchant association the alliance formed a loose Diet, or parliament, to govern inter-city trade and common policies. In most respects the policy of the merchants was protectionist and aimed at producing a German monopoly in the markets they supplied. The Hanseatic Diet met only infrequently and was filled with divisive politics based on differences in regional priorities. It was more frequent that the regional assemblies, known as "thirds", met. There was a Rhennish third based on the Rhine trade, a Wendish third based on Baltic shipping out of Luebeck, and a Prussian third based on the trade of grain from the lands of the Teutonic Order. The predominant town in all dealings was Luebeck, which held a central position at the Baltic side of the Danish Sound. Other member cities often complained that the merchants from Luebeck were given advantages over their own merchants. While most of the cities in the Hansa were within the domains of local feudal lords and the citizens of these cities were feudal vassals Luebeck was one of the few "free cities" or more properly, it was an imperial city which owed its allegiance to the emperor alone. This in itself gave Luebeck an advantage over many of the other cities. When added to that are the position it held geographically and the access it had to the rich herring fisheries its predominant position in the alliance is understandable. Almost all trade to the Baltic, either coming or going, went through the port of Luebeck.',

'The Székely (Szeklers) a subgroup of the Hungarian people. Their language is a dialect of Hungarian, and according to their legends they are descended from Attila''s huns who remained in the Carpathian basin following the fall of the Hun empire. All we know for certain is that the Székely greeted the arriving Magyars in 896 with open arms and helped them conquer the Carpathian basin.',
'Székelyföld (latin:. terra Siculorum eng:. Land of the Szeklers) is the name used for the territory granted by the Hungarian state to be settled by the Szeklers. Settlement of the populace and the division of land was dependent on the ancient Szekler clan system: each member of the Szekler nation was a part of a "nem" or clan, therefore the various "nemek" settled close to each other.',
'"A Székely határőrség kialakítása" (English: the organization of the Szekler border guards) is the reinforcement of the forces defending the borders of this province with mounted Székely horse archers called the Lövők (Sharpshooters). The duties of these federal guards included the organization of border patrols, the protection of the royal trade caravans, that transported salt, livestock (such as horses and cattle), iron, gold and silver throughout the Kingdom, as well as the protection of travelers who crossed into Hungary.',
'The Szeklers of this province are abandoning pastoralism in favor of farming and other settled activities. To understand the importance of this transition from nomadic to the settled way of life, one must examine Székely society prior to the transition. Initially the territory in which the Szeklers would settle was collectively owned by the nation as a whole, with the lands being divided among the various ''nemek'' (clans) who utilized the lands mainly for grazing their animals.',
'The Szeklers of this province are being granted special rights, to complement their already autonomous laws, collectively called as "Székely jog" or Szekler law. In the history of the Szekler people, laws were extremely important. After settling in an area, Szekler law would be valid in the various settlements, and applied to the Szekler nation as a whole, as well as the individual. Szekler law was defined as the law applicable to all members of the Székely nation.',
'Kollektív birtokadományok'' or collective grants of land are being issued to the Szeklers of this province by the Hungarian state. According to Szekler law each member of the Szekler nation is a freeman, their property could not be confiscated, and everyone was regarded as an equal: effectively this is the definition of collective nobility. However, they did not have the right of "jus proprietatis" or ''right of property'': the lands owned by the Szekler nation were owned by the community as a whole, with lands being granted for farming to the members of the community which could not be sold.',
'The Comitatus Siculorum (english: Székely Earldom) is the reformation of the old Székely tribal system. Previously, the Székely''s in this province were led by the tribal leaders and the heads of the largest clans: however, with this reform, the King delegates a Székely Ispán (earl) to organize and coordinate the Székely forces of this province.',
'The establishment of a permanent forum for discussion regarding internal matters in the Székely holds leads to the establishment of the "Székely nemzetgyűlés" (literally: gathering of the Szekler nation) or Szekler diet. Following it''s establishment, the Székely nemzetgyűlés becomes the chief legislative body within the Szekler lands.',
'An administrative reform is being instituted in this province, which will lead to the establishment of the ''Székely székek'' or Szekler seats, which are special autonomous administrative counties populated exclusively by Székely people. The reform grants legislative and judicial autonomy to the Szeklers themselves. The new division means that the various ''Székek'' divide the Székelyföld (Szeklerland), with with the Széks making up the Comitatus or Ispánság, led by the Székelyek Ispánja (latin:. comes Siculorum eng:. Earl of the Szeklers).',
'This building marks the invitation and settlement of the"segédnépek" (allied tribes) in this province. The "Katonai segédnépek" was the collective name for the various auxiliary forces made up out of the various ethnic groups that joined the Magyar tribes before (the Kabars, the Böszörmény and the Káliz) during (Slavs) and after (the Becsenek [English: Pechenegs]) the conquest of the Carpathian basin. These various nationalities were usually settled in previously uninhabited areas within the province, with each ethnic group being granted their own territory.',
'Out of those people who arrived from the steppe to settle in Hungarian territories, the Kunok (Cumans) and the Jászok (Alans) were the most numerous. These peoples, who were predominantly nomads, consisting of many tribes and ethnicities were referred to as Cumans - even though the term "Cuman" most likely meant the strongest tribe that constituted only a fraction of the tribal alliance. In exchange for being granted settling rights within this province, the Cumans and the Alans provide fearsome light cavalry and mounted archer auxiliary troops for the Hungarian state.',
'The "Nemzetiségi ispánságok" or ethnic earldoms is an administrative region within this province. These groups, which had been settled in regions owned by the monarch had no definitive leader, as they were broken up into clans and tribes. Therefore to settle the various disputes between the clans and tribes, as well as to have a military leader that would lead them in war, the position of Ispán (earl) was established for all the ethnic groups.',
'The creation of special "Nemzetiségi szabadságjogok" or ethnic freedoms is the institution of granting special rights to the various steppe groups inhabiting this province. The most important right granted to them is their autonomy judicially. Instead of presenting their cases to the regional state authority, they could settle their smaller issues internally, whilst the important issues would be settled by the Nádor (count-palatine of Hungary). They were also allowed to keep their social hierarchical system in place.',
'"Kollektív földadományok" or collective grants of land are being issued to the various ethnic groups within this province. The various ethnic groups that served the Hungarian state as border guards and provided auxiliary forces for the Hungarian military were mostly nomads. Having being granted lands in uninhabited or sparsely inhabited areas belonging to the King, they began to overpopulate these areas, as well as their animals began to graze other areas that didn''t belong to them.',
'"Kollektív nemesség" or the collective grants of nobility to all members of the various ethnic groups settled here by the Hungarian state is being instituted in this province. The collective grant of nobility to a group in feudalism meant that although the various members of did not reach the rank of noble in the social hierarchy individually (most importantly the rights of a freeman), but in exchange for certain duties (such as providing auxiliary forces in wartime) or for settling in a specific region (such as a border region to guard the border of the province) they were granted rights akin to that of nobility.',
'The organization of " Nemzetiségi székek" or Ethnic Seats is being instituted within this province. The "Seats" were special autonomous regions within the Hungarian state. These counties acted as separate municipalities, governed by the local elite. Each of these nationalities are granted their own "Széks", with the Széks making up the Comitatus or Ispánság, led by the Ispán (Earl) who was the highest ranking member of the ethnic group. The military duties of the Szék''s were organized by the "Szék Kapitányok", or captains of the Széks. Their duties included the organization of the military forces provided by the Széks, checking their equipment and creating a census of those men eligible for military service.',
'"A nemzetiségek erőszakos térítése" or the forced christianization of the populace by the state is a policy being adopted in this province. The various ethnic groups that were invited to settle within this province are causing major unrest. Although formally they have accepted the state religion of Catholicism, they continue to pursue their past religions, which is decreasing the effectiveness of the policy of supporting the spread of christianity within this province.',
'A policy called "A nemzetiségek beolvasztása" or the assimilation of the various invited ethnic groups is being instituted in this province. Following the christianization of the populace, the next step in assimilating these peoples is the establishment of feudalism. The various peoples that settled within this province have previously had their own tribal system based on clans (nemzetségek), where every member of the society was regarded as a freeman, which the ruling elite being the leaders of the various clans.',
'The policy of "Exclusio Hospites" is being instituted within this province. The words themselves mean "the exclusion of foreign guests". The Hungarian state stands at a crossroad regarding immigration policy within this province: should the state support the settlement of foreign, mostly western nobles or Hungarian nobles to form the new ruling elite within this province?',
'The "Saxones" or Szászok is the collective name for the predominantly German speaking settlers that have arrived as immigrants to populate this province. These immigrants are mainly from overpopulated areas all throughout western Europe. The areas they are being settled in are mainly densely forested areas and uninhabited areas that the immigrants will cut down to make way for cities, villages and fields for plowing.',
'The "Hospes" (guests) were initially immigrants from western countries, mainly nobles and knights, who left their homeland due to overpopulation, wanderlust or political reasons, and in some cases they were invited by the royal court. These immigrants were from northern Italy and western Europe, mainly from Bavaria and Swabia. There were also massive populations of Englishmen after the defeat at Hastings and the dispossession of Anglo-Saxon gentry by Norman lords.',
'The "Hospites Flandrenses" or Flemish guests was the name the native Hungarian population gave to the new settlers who were invited by the Kings of Hungary to settle in previously uninhabited lands called "deserta" within the province. Although the name suggests that they were from Flanders and Wallonia , most of the settlers were from the Mosel-Rhein river regions, and other areas in western Europe, although Flemish people can be found among them as well.',
'The Királyfölde (latin: Fundus Regius, english: Land of the King) were large regions within provinces owned exclusively by the King, where the Szász (or Saxon) immigrants were settled. These areas, which were sparsely or completely uninhabited, had dense forests, untouched mineral veins, and unused lakes and rivers: thus providing an incredibly abundant place to live for the colonists. The immigrants, who were collectively referred to as "Szászok" (Saxons) were German speaking people from Saxony, Bavaria, Swabia, Flanders and Walloonia.',
'Altland meaning "old land" refers to the area settled by the Saxons first in a province. After populating the previously uninhabited territory owned by the King called "Fundus Regius", the Saxons would start to branch out, and request special rights and autonomy on their lands from the monarchs of Hungary.',
'The Diploma Saxonum grants provisional autonomy to the colonial Germand and other western immigrants known as "Szászok" (Saxons) residing within this province. The Saxons who were mainly built up out of Flemish, Walloon, Swabian, Saxon and Bavarian colonists from the west (incorrectly called by the natives as "Szászok").',
'The "Sedes Saxonum" (Királyi Szász Székek or Royal Saxon counties) are special administrative units within the Kingdom of Hungary, inhabited by the "Szász" (or Saxons) a German speaking ethnic minority, with special rights, granted by the King''s diploma. The Saxons, who were built up out of western colonists ranging from Anglo-Saxons, to Walloons and Flemish people, as well as immigrants from the Holy Roman Empire inhabited an area owned by the Royal Crown called Fundus Regius (The Land of the King) sought additional protection and autonomy within the province.',
'Unio Trium Nationum (Latin for Union of the Three Nations) was a pact of mutual aid formed by the three Estates of Transylvania: the Hungarian nobility, the Saxon burghers, and the free Szeklers. Following the increase of the discontent due to tax increases and extensive wars among the Serfs, the Union ensured that the serfs continued to be excluded from the political and social life of Transylvania, although they made up the majority of the population in the Noble Counties (Comitates).',
'The "Gyepűrendszer" or Fallow lands, originally conceived by Magyar tribes as outlands beyond the settlements was used for grazing their horses and acting as a form of open buffer zone against foreign states. The Gyepű was a strip of land that was specially fortified or made impassable, while the Gyepűelve was the mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited land beyond it.',
'The reorganization of the administrative division of this province is being instituted. The new system that will be instituted is called the "Várispánság" (Castle-Earldoms) reform. This does not mean the immediate abolishment of the gyepű system however, as the new administrative division will only supplement and increase the effectiveness of the fortifications in this province to defend the border and the heartland. The new reform redistributes the lands as well, placing all fortifications into the hands of the King.',
'The Határvármegye system (latin: Marchia english: border counties) were special administrative counties within the Kingdom tasked with guarding the border regions of Hungary. Traditionally the Hungarian border was defended by the "Gyepű" or fallow lands, which were naturally and artifically fortified uninhabited or sparsely inhabited regions at the very edge of the province, which acted as a buffer zone between Hungary and foreign states.',
'The "Végvár" or Citadel reform is a martial reform that adovcated the construction of new fortifications, the improvement of the already existing fortifications, and revised the duties of the men serving in the various fortifications scattered along the border and throughout the province. Since the appearance of gunpowder made the iconic extremely tall, yet thin walls of the Hungarians obsolete, the reform commanded the destruction of all stone walls and in their place stronger, thicker walls were added with artillery support.',
'"A Bánságok kialakítása" (the creation of the Banates) is an administrative reform being enacted within this province. The "Bánságok" or Banates were special autonomous provinces headed by the "Bán" or Ban. The Bán''s answered directly to the King, therefore they were in essence monarchs in their own land. The title of Ban however could be revoked at any time, and usually it did not last a lifetime for the bearer of the title.',
'The "Királyi vármegye" (royal county) reform is an administrative reform that changes several aspects in the governence of this province. First of all, the division of land is restructurized. One third of he land is divded amongst the Hungarian ruling class, and royal family members. Out of the remaining two thirds of the land, a small portion is relegated to the clergy, and another small portion sreserved for royal hunting grounds and estates for the monarch, with the remainder constituting the "Vármegyék" (counties).',
'This administrative reform grants special rights for the "Szerviensi közösségek" or Servient communities. The word "Szerviens" means ''Servant of the King''. These men were nobles and freemen who did have lands of their own and a few serfs which placed them above the serfs in the social hierarchy, however the size of their lands (which were quite small) prevented them from joining the ruling elite. Following the reformation of the administration in this province via the "Királyi Vármegye" (Royal county) reform, many of these impoverished nobles and freemen lost their lands, and they therefore flocked to the nearest high ranking noble who could grant them land, thus they began to fortify the position of several nobles which became oligarchs via possessing large quantities of land that only they could own.',
'The "Nemesi vármegye" (nobiliary county) is an administrative reform being instituted in this province. With the strengthening of the gentry in Hungary following the rights granted to the Szerviensek (low ranking nobles serving in the Hungarian military directly under the King in exchange for special rights and lands granted by the King) the administration of the "Királyi Vármegyék" (royal counties) began to transform.',
'A large scale administrative reform (Közigazgatási reform) is being instituted in this province. Firstly, a new taxation reform was introduced. Due to the increasing gap between the lower classes (where some serfs were rich enough to lease lands from a noblemen, whilst others had just enough land to sustain their family and pay taxes) the "Kapu-adó" or Gate tax was instituted. The Gate tax was collected from the peasantry after every gate, where a cart could go through, due to the fact that only the richer peasants owned carts of their own.',

'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',
'The sheer size of these magnificent defences is enough to awe the peasants who work in their shadow! These walls are extremely costly, but that price guarantees security against all but the most well-prepared besieging force. Thanks to strong towers, battlements and gatehouses, the defenders can make any assault a chancy business.',

'A Port brings trade to a settlement. Indeed, moving goods by water is the only way to carry large cargoes long distances cheaply and thus turn a profit. The need to keep merchant ships in good order also means that the necessary skills to make military vessels can be found here.',
'A Shipwright has the slipway, wood seasoning stores and manpower needed to build ships for a strong fleet. The improved port buildings - and simple improvements like creating permanent wharves along a waterfront - allow more trade to occur.',
'A Dockyard allows the construction of larger ships, and the improved wharves make trade easier to manage. Goods from all over the world pass through the docks, bringing wealth and excitement into the lives of citizens.',
'A Naval Dockyard allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the port to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',

'Roads developed naturally over a period of time. Firstly they were established by common traffic, often herdsmen who wandering across the landscape with their flocks would usually unconsciously or via the instincts of their animals find the most logical path from A to B. A network of these tracks would then tie together to allow tradesmen and perhaps soldiers to move directly between the villages and hinterland dwellings actoss the region.',
'Paved Roads outside of a settlement were a rarity in the medieval age, they required some orgnaisation by the ruling class and a means of gathering and using a large supply of materials- from quarry workers to gain the stone, to surveyors who would trace the path across the landscape in the easiest places to build that would neither flood nor expose the road to banditry. It would offer the best possible surface for both armies and traders to traverse quickly. They are particularly useful for kingdoms and empires that have distant boundaries that need a means to send troops to the front quickly enough to be effective.',

'Žemgrinda (Samogitian dialect: žemė (earth) + grinda (pavement) is a hidden underwater stony road or ford across swamps and swampy areas used for defense by the Pagan Balts. Undetectable from the surface, these roads were usually known only to the locals, and as such were an important element of the defense against various invaders, including the Teutonic Knights in the 13–14th centuries. As such, they were considerd Military secrets and anyone showing the routes to enemies would be severely punished. It is estimated that Lithuania has 27 kūlgrindas and 7 medgrindas, about half of them are located in Samogitia. The longest and best-known surviving Kūlgrinda is across the Sietuva swamp between the lakes Lūkštas and Paršežeris in Samogitia.Kūlgrindas provided a safe shortcut between villages, hillforts, and other defensive structures. They were built by bringing stones, wood, or gravel over frozen swamps in the winter and letting them sink once the ice melted. Such procedure would be repeated several times. Sometimes wooden posts were inserted to protect the elevated area from washing away.',

'Land Clearance is the first step on the road to establishing organised farming in the countryside, and ensuring that a region will begin to grow and prosper. Though there is little more to land clearance than deforestation and basic tilling of the soil, any area where the local establishment has not taken such measures to make the land workable will struggle to feed its populace.',
'Communal Farming is the natural progression from land clearance, where the farming communities adopt a system of centralised management. By sharing common resources and transportation, communal farming sees all the individual farms in the community achieve a level of productivity, prosperity and security that would otherwise be unattainable.',
'Crop Rotation is a more advanced farming system that maximises the use of farming districts all year round. Going to the trouble of planting different crops in different seasons not only ensures that something is always growing, varying the produce actually improves the soil quality markedly so as to reap greater harvests all year round.',
'Irrigation represents the final frontier in terms of actively improving farming districts. Water is diverted to crops via a system of man-made channels dug into the earth so as to dramatically improve soil fertility. Although irrigating the land is grand and arduous task, and maintaining proper irrigation is an ongoing job, the benefits from the resulting surplus of food produced make the endeavour well worth it.',

'Conscription represents the call to arms in a region, where the ruler raises a national army for rapid deployment. Conscription buildings allow European factions to quickly gain access to a wide range of units without the need for a developed military infrastucture such as stables, barracks or bowyers. Instead, each tier of the conscription allows a mix of unit types dependent on social class. The higher the conscription level the more elite and noble the units available. Be careful however, conscription was extremely unpopular with the people, and should only be used in emergencies for defence or summoning large armies for a campaign. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands! This level requires Provincial Charters, and allows access to levies from the countryside.',
'Conscription level 2 allows access to units of militia level, usually from town guards or peasant classes. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands!',

'The first thing that must be done in order to establish a formal place of worship is to find a place that is sacred to the gods, known as Alka or Alkas in Lithuanian. These could be Hills, Fields, Groves, Stones and Waters. There were many sacred places in the world with often shared similar traits.',
'Sacred Groves were some of the most common sacred places for the Balts. There were three types of sacred groves that one would find: Šventas, Alka and Gojus. In it, one would also generally find a basic Fire Altar that would be used for offerings and prayers to the Gods.',
'Sacred Groves were some of the most common sacred places for the Balts. There were three types of sacred groves that one would find: Šventas, Alka and Gojus. Šventas Groves would be like the modern Dvariškai grove in Lithuanian. These are typically identified as being near the confluences of rivers such as at Daubaria, Romainiai and Rukškiai.',
'Eventually, When a Village grows enough, it needs a complex of various things in order to meet the needs of the community. With this, a town would see multiples groves, stones and waters as part of a larger scared complex complete with a central fire altar and sacrificial stone for the community to convene as well as a cremation site for the dead. This last part was especially important since it was a defining factor in religious identity. As S.C. Rowell wrote: "There are stories of pagan apostates who threw off the new religion and exhumed their wives and loved ones from Christian graves to reconsign them to paradise by fire in the holy places". It was also believed that in the afterlife, the dead would travel to Dausos where they first needed to climb up a great Hill or Mountain, If they were cremated, they could "Ride the Smoke" up. This belief in Cremation had a name, Sovitsa or Sovidom, which supposedly came from a Prussian leader named Sovii, who contacted his songs through the dead about which burial was most comfortable. As the legend goes, When Sovii was buried in a coffin, he was tormented by slugs and worms. When the son laid out his father in a tree, Sovii''s soul was tormented as though stung by',
'This construction is the same as the earlier pagan complex, but has a new and useful addition.... an Observatory. On top of a sacred Hill, there would be an Observatory build that would help in keeping track of the time via the heavens. Defining the dates and ritual marking of the dates must have been of crucial importance in the traditional Baltic and Old Lithuanian cultures whose life organization was carried in compliance with the Sun and the Moon calendar. As such, this was important in that it could be used to find the best times for religious rituals, and this also improve the farming output due to better timing.',
'Much the same as the Pagan Complex. This Construction adds a Eternal Fire, staffed 24/7 by Vaidilutė and other Pagan Clergy. The Eternal fire is a public Symbol that Paganism is alive and well. As such, it becomes a symbold of Lithuania''s defiance in a Christian world. Knowing that other seek to extinguish this symbol can increase the public''s desire to pick up the axe, sword and spear to fight the Crusader.',
'With Lithuania in constant contact through Christian nation in both Trade and war, Lithuanian Paganism has adapted itself to adopt various idea from the Christians. One of these ideas are Stone temples. These buildings show both fellow pagans as well as visiting Christians that anything the Christians can do, they can do aswell. In addition, this also shows the final fruit of the Grand Dukes attempt to turn the Ethnic Religion into a state religion centralized in such a way that gives them more power over the populace.',
'The Temple of Perkūnas in Vilnius was the first Stone Temple and was a breakthrough in the Religion''s organization. The Long Construction time is not so much related to the time it takes to actually build the Temple as much as it represents the time that it takes to centralize the religious hierarchy, Shifting from Communal leaders and the smorgasbord of Priestly classes to one lead by the Rulers.',
'The Orthodox Church was manipulated by the Grand Duke as a tool for conducting Lettovian policy. Dukes such as Gediminas also exploited Catholicism to make military, political and commercial alliances with Catholic princes including, briefly, Pope John XXII , and to attract Catholic, that is German, technology to Lithuania. Franciscans copied correspondence for the grand duke, but Gediminas circumscribed the activity of Catholic friars so as to prevent them from preaching Christ to the infidel. The reason Catholic priests were invited to Lithuania was to comfort Christians who came to reside in Vilnius and Novgorodok and serve the grand duke, not proselytizing. To prevent them from preaching, stiff punishments were prescribed by law requiring the priest apostasise or be killed. in the single year between 1369-70, five Franciscans and three Orthodox laymen were executed in separate incidents for public defiance of this order showing its enforcement. The most Famous example, that of Ulrich and Martin in 1369-70, was recorded in "Franciscan Chronica XXIV Generalium": "Two friars of the Bohemian province made their way to Vilnius fired with zeal to preach the Gospel. It was while Martin was celebrating Mass in ''loco fratrum'' that Ulrich took up a cross and went out into the market place to preach against the heathens. The townsfolk were enraged, seized Ulrich and brought him before Gediminas. In the grand duke''s presence the friar refused to apostasise in accordance with Gediminas'' command, thereby causing the irate duke to sentence him to death. Gediminas then sent for Ulrich''s companion and asked him why he had come to Vilnius. Martin replied that he had come to show Gediminas and his people the error of their ways and to preach to them the one true God. This frankness was rewarded with consignment to gaol. Meanwhile, Ulrich was tortured and killed, his body being tossed into the river to float downstream to crusader territory pour décourager les autres, as it were. Gediminas now turned his attention to Martin and sought in vain to persuade him to abjure. The friar died under torture and his body was left for the dogs to devour."',

'Literally: "commune" were peasant communities, as opposed to individual farmsteads. The vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within a mir community, which acted as a village government and a cooperative. Arable land was divided in sections based on soil quality and distance from the village. Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household. The purpose of this allocation was not so much social (to each according to his needs) as it was practical (that each person pay his taxes). Strips were periodically re-allocated on the basis of a census, to ensure equitable share of the land. This was enforced by the state, which had an interest in the ability of households to pay their taxes.',
'Enclaves on the borders used for defence, such as abatises. Usually these were open tracts of wasteland wihere watchtowers, beacons and small royal militia garrisons were based. Commonly slaves and rebels would actually run away into such territories or outlands making them even more hostile for foreigners.',
'As the establishment of towns and urban centres developed the class system in Russia became much clearer and the subjection of the urban peasantry allowed assignment of order, taxes and the proper placement of workers to various trades.',
'Urban commoner''s self-government was something similar to a mayoral quarter. With self-government the organisation and independence of the community was strengthened.',
'Unfortified suburbs growing outside the city walls or around a citadel was common in medieval Russia. In some ways they had a tactical benefit in times of siege although the health issues of poor quaters at the edges of the city, and the lack of rule and vulnerability to both criminals within and bandits from the outside made these places to avoid for good people.',
'Serfdom included the prohibition of peasants’ departure from their holdings (the binding of peasants to the soil, with fugitives subject to compulsory return), hereditary subordination to the administrative and judicial authority of a particular feudal lord, the loss of peasants’ right to alienate holdings and acquire immovable property, and, sometimes, the right of the feudal lord to alienate peasants without land. In Russia, serfdom became an extremely important element in agrarian social relations. It marked the development of entrepreneurial landlord farms for the production of agricultural produce for the market, and the political ascendancy of a nobility interested in ensuring unrestrained exploitation of the peasants.',
'Literally ''rural dwellersr, Russian peasantry had much in common with other parts fo the world. Freedoms were negligible or varying and were dependent on the local elements of feudal service. In many cases the common masses were in this strata of society fairly lucky, in that they were above slavery and for the most part could work for themselves as well as for their lords.',
'The rise of taxable estates in a region gave a massive boost to the feudal system, free farmers were subject to lords and overall it solidified the entire social chain and the means to exert law and influence power across the entire territory.',
'Military service obligations were the height of the feudal system, comparable to sergeantry or baronial estates in the west. These large and independent lordships were themselves responsible for the communities under their government, this alleviated the pressure on the royalty to ensure heavier controls and expend otherwise valuable military resources. In turn, levies could be called not only from the barons but from the people but relying on those local lords to achieve it.',

These people, however, were not serfs, as they had a right to freely move to different votchinas. This was similar to the western freeholdings or villeinry. It was popular among the people but did not provide a great deal of income from agriculture since there was no strict and formal taxation. ',
'Feudal rule, this was part of a larger social and political move of the entire nation. In this system, a noble was appointed to a service position on the basis of their family’s rank.

'Service landholding, was a parcel of land (hopefully inhabited by rent-paying peasants, later serfs in exchange for which the holder (not owner) had to render lifelong service to the state, typically military service, but occasionally service in the government bureaucracy. Ideally, when the service ended, the landholder had to surrender the pomestie to another serviceman. The pomestie was granted for use only to support the serviceman and his family (including slaves) by peasant rent payments to him in lieu of cash. This was similar to western feudalism such as sergeantry. This system granted law, and a large source of tax and agriculture since the state controlled all aspects of government.',
'Several great Russian Principalities had a Golden Gate as the central entrance within their walls. The passing part of the gates was usually about 40 feet high and 20 feet wide. For almost half of millennium they served as the Triumph Arch of the city and were considered the major pride of the city''s residents. They seem to have been modeled on the Golden Gate of Constantinople, from which they took their name. The actual origin of this adaptation into RUssian culture may have come from the Korsun Treasurethe copper Korsun Gate, supposedly captured by the Novgorodians in the sacking of Chersonesos during the Rus''–Byzantine War of 1043 and now part of the St. Sophia Cathedral.',

'The Russians were ever on the move east and in the early period this was checked by the might of the Cumans and in the late period by the Mongols, however in the early period there was an attempt to colonise and subjugate the ''freemen'' or Khazaks (Cossacks) of the Steppe, and in 1400s when the Russian Tsar ceased the tribute payments to the Mongols the movement eastwards continued. A setch is a settlement of nomads, a rather self-contradictory concept but as a meeting place and trade outpost it formed the first basic step in ‘civilising the barbarians’.',
'Stanitsas were the primary unit of Cossack hosts. Historically, the stanitsa was a unit of economic and political organisation of the Cossack peoples primarily in the southern regions of the Russian Empire. Much of the land was held in common by the stanitsa, subject to annual allocation to Cossack families by the Ataman, the appointed leader of the community. This was an autocratic process, and subject to patronage, nepotism and other forms of corruption, but a degree of consent was required, within the militarised Cossack society, that limited the worst abuses. Stanitsas were hierarchical societies analogous to military and regimental structures, relying on the inbuilt conservatism and longstanding traditions of the subject people, and the element of common landholding should not be confused with either democracy or equality. This form of society can be contrasted with the much more permanent forms of peasant economy operating within the Russian empire of the time, in which each peasant family worked the same area of land on a long term basis and was responsible for its productivity and yield.

'Yassak is a Turkic word for "tribute" that was used in Imperial Russia to designate fur tribute exacted from the indigenous peoples of Siberia. The origins of yasak may be traced to a tax collected from native, primarily non-Turkic populations in the Golden Horde. There is much uncertainty as to the time when the concept of yasak was introduced in Russia. It appears likely that the tax was inherited by the Rus from the Volga khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan - two fragments of the Golden Horde that later were subjugated or reclaimed by the Russians. It represents the fully fledged state of vassalage.',
'A Steppe host, also inferring a military organisation, this was the realm of the nomad tribe and the claims he laid claim to.

'Usury from Medieval Latin usuria, "interest", or from Latin usura, "interest" originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as investment and capital. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. The term is largely derived from Christian religious principles; Riba is the corresponding Arabic term and ribbit is the Hebrew word. The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury (canon 17). At the time, usury was interest of any kind, and the canon merely forbade the clergy to lend money on interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% APR). Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity. The Third Lateran Council decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor Christian burial. Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury a heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation which allowed it. Pope Sixtus V condemned the practice of charging interest as "detestable to God and man, damned by the sacred canons and contrary to Christian charity." All of this however, had absolutely no application to Jews. The Torah makes a distinction between interest deducted before the loan is handed over and interest deducted afterwards. What is clear – as with so much of the Old Testament – is that many prohibitions applied within the Jewish community did not apply outside. In other words, there was a loophole allowing interest to be charged to gentiles. Nonetheless Talmudic Law confined Jewish interest rates to 20%. With the rise of Templar banking and Italian banking who both had comparatively astronomical interest rates (possibly due to the social constrictions which they had found loopholes through) Jewish banking remained extremely popular due to its fairness. As the Jews were ostracized from most professions by local rulers, the church and the guilds, they were pushed into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending. Natural tensions between creditors and debtors were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Precisely in the same way that the aristoricies and European royal families found themselves indebted to the Templars and thereby conspired their demise, so Jews were pushed out of Europe. In 1275, Edward I of England passed the Statute of Jewry which made usury illegal and linked it to blasphemy, in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to the Crown. In 1290, all Jews were expelled from England, and allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown''s. The usury was cited as the official reason for the Edict of Expulsion. The violence targetted at Jews increased in Europe, no doubt encouraged by the indebted aristocracy. In time Italian bankers won the financial war and their way of doing business transformed European commerce, dragging Europe into the Renaissance.',

'A Hansa Kontor, was simply an administrative office for the clerks, merchants and officers of trade to conduct business. The sheer organisational abilities of the Hansa meant that such an office in a foreign port was a powerful –and wealthy- force. In many ways a Kontor could spread through a city making a small city district and naturally begun to upset the local merchants because they aggressively outsourced them.',
'A Hansa city was an official recognition, usually by the Imperial forces that had now come to use the Hansa as a colonising force. The establishment of a Hansa City brought with it extensive security measures to ensure safe passage of shipping and trade over land as well. It allowed trade to be conducted in a much more organised manner which in turn was much more efficient at harvesting tax revenue for the local lords and the king.',
'The trade between the merchant associations of Hamburg and Luebeck provided a model for the merchant associations of the other North German cities to follow. In 1201 Cologne, already wealthy, joined the league. Danzig, whose port was a gateway to the eastern Baltic also joined as did most of the important Baltic port cities. By the height of the Hansa''s power merchants from over sixty cities had joined the association. While each city had its own merchant association the alliance formed a loose Diet, or parliament, to govern inter-city trade and common policies. In most respects the policy of the merchants was protectionist and aimed at producing a German monopoly in the markets they supplied. The Hanseatic Diet met only infrequently and was filled with divisive politics based on differences in regional priorities. It was more frequent that the regional assemblies, known as "thirds", met. There was a Rhennish third based on the Rhine trade, a Wendish third based on Baltic shipping out of Luebeck, and a Prussian third based on the trade of grain from the lands of the Teutonic Order. The predominant town in all dealings was Luebeck, which held a central position at the Baltic side of the Danish Sound. Other member cities often complained that the merchants from Luebeck were given advantages over their own merchants. While most of the cities in the Hansa were within the domains of local feudal lords and the citizens of these cities were feudal vassals Luebeck was one of the few "free cities" or more properly, it was an imperial city which owed its allegiance to the emperor alone. This in itself gave Luebeck an advantage over many of the other cities. When added to that are the position it held geographically and the access it had to the rich herring fisheries its predominant position in the alliance is understandable. Almost all trade to the Baltic, either coming or going, went through the port of Luebeck.',

'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',
'The sheer size of these magnificent defences is enough to awe the peasants who work in their shadow! These walls are extremely costly, but that price guarantees security against all but the most well-prepared besieging force. Thanks to strong towers, battlements and gatehouses, the defenders can make any assault a chancy business.',

'A Port brings trade to a settlement. Indeed, moving goods by water is the only way to carry large cargoes long distances cheaply and thus turn a profit. The need to keep merchant ships in good order also means that the necessary skills to make military vessels can be found here.',
'A Shipwright has the slipway, wood seasoning stores and manpower needed to build ships for a strong fleet. The improved port buildings - and simple improvements like creating permanent wharves along a waterfront - allow more trade to occur.',
'A Dockyard allows the construction of larger ships, and the improved wharves make trade easier to manage. Goods from all over the world pass through the docks, bringing wealth and excitement into the lives of citizens.',
'A Naval Dockyard allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the port to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',
'Huge port',
'The Roman Empire lost its uncontested control of the Mediterranean following the Battle of the Masts in 655, and from then on, smaller and lighter merchant ships became common, in contrast to the hulking vessels of antiquity. A Byzantine merchant ship would often be referred to as a "Dorkon", meaning "gazelle", in reference to its speed and agility. Shallow keels and rounded hulls were the order of the day- these merchant ships were designed to be at ease in shallow and calm coastal waters, and would struggle in deep sea. Nonetheless, shipping remained by far the cheapest and quickest way of transporting goods throughout the Byzantine period. ',
'Constantinople''s grain dole, inaugurated by Constantine the Great, was abolished in 618 with the fall of Egypt to the Iranians, but from the eighth century onwards, the city once more enjoyed some sort of subsidy in grain, with free bread being doled out at major imperial ceremonies throughout the year. To allow this, grain fleets were neccesary, generally operating on an axis from the northern Black Sea to Constantinople. ',
'From the reign of Leo III (717-741) onward responsibility for the Byzantine fleet was vested in the Strategos of the Kibyrrhaiotai in southern Anatolia, who was joined in the ninth century by a Strategos of Samos. A "home fleet" existed in Constantinople too, under the command of the Droungarios tou Ploimou. Byzantine naval supremacy was fairly shortlived- only in the second half of the tenth century was the Empire really on top of things, and by the reign of Basil II vassal states like Venice were already being drafted in to save the costly expense of maintaining a fleet. By the reign of John II (1118-1143) a permanent fleet ceased to be maintained, and fleets were only raised on an ad-hoc bonus, increasing Byzantine dependence upon increasingly unreliable and powerful Italian "vassals"- something that contributed catastrophically to the long decline that began after the 1180s. ',
'As the need to move increasing quantities of goods and people throughout a region grows, so too grows the call for proper roads. While there are paths to most every populated place in the known world, when the local ruling class invests in clearing debris and packing the earth to produce lasting Dirt Roads, the benefits in increased troop movement and trade soon become obvious.',
'Roman public roads continued to function long after the foundation of Constantinople, though the budget cuts of Justinian I following the bubonic plague of 542 saw their subsidy slashed, and many routes abandoned, becoming small, pitted tracks. Responsibility for the maintenance of roads went to the rural communities, whose duties were known as "hodostrosia", and this was certainly still the case until at least the eleventh century. ',
'A few of the old Roman highways continued to recieve subsidy from the state throughout the Byzantine period, notably the Via Egnatia which ran from Dyrrachium to Constantinople. The duty for maintenance of these important highways was shouldered by the state, not local provincials, which generally meant a very well maintained structure for the use of the imperial armies. ',

'Land Clearance is the first step on the road to establishing organised farming in the countryside, and ensuring that a region will begin to grow and prosper. Though there is little more to land clearance than deforestation and basic tilling of the soil, any area where the local establishment has not taken such measures to make the land workable will struggle to feed its populace.',
'Communal Farming is the natural progression from land clearance, where the farming communities adopt a system of centralised management. By sharing common resources and transportation, communal farming sees all the individual farms in the community achieve a level of productivity, prosperity and security that would otherwise be unattainable.',
'Crop Rotation is a more advanced farming system that maximises the use of farming districts all year round. Going to the trouble of planting different crops in different seasons not only ensures that something is always growing, varying the produce actually improves the soil quality markedly so as to reap greater harvests all year round.',
'Irrigation represents the final frontier in terms of actively improving farming districts. Water is diverted to crops via a system of man-made channels dug into the earth so as to dramatically improve soil fertility. Although irrigating the land is grand and arduous task, and maintaining proper irrigation is an ongoing job, the benefits from the resulting surplus of food produced make the endeavour well worth it.',
'The military register'' was an official state document regulating the number and division of military forces similar to Gahnamak. Zoranamak was based on the military strength of the houses, i.e. the number of possessed cavalry and infantry, responsibility in defending the northern, eastern, southern and western borders of Armenia, as well as the size of the troops that the noble houses were placing under the command of the king of Armenia in times of military campaigns. This construction represents the entrance of this settlement into the control of a powerful military entity in the high ranks of the faction.',

'Ancestral Meeting Place, these were usually centred around ancestral graves and on the lowest level were simply conducted by family groups. Naturally this was sometimes extended to great clans and on occassion the royalty and his retinue or staff. It was expected to carry out Tohmahavak during any traditional holiday; for example in the province of Tavush or in Artsakh some families carry out their ancestral meetings during the heathen holiday of water - Vardavar. Typically Tohmahavak involved a visit to the graves of ancestors and the rites of pagan and Christian origin such as offerings -matakh as well as baptism and so on.',
'Bardz literally means "cushion" it was a institute of the old Kingdom of Armenia. It was the seat that was occupied by the head of the noble houses at the royal table, be it during the council or during the festivities. The word bardz derives from these cushions on which the lords of houses were seated on special occasions. Bardzes were not literally cushioned seats at the royal table but more broadly identified the actual status at the royal court - distributed on the basis of pativ, i.e. literally the honor and esteem of the noble houses.',
'An official state document of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia, a list of places and thrones (bardzes) that the Armenian princes and naharars were occupying at the royal court of Armenia. The throne of the prince or naharar was defined by his economic or military strength (according to the Zoranamak, from Middle Persian Zor namag, literally: "strength registrar"), as well as according to the ancient tradition. Gahnamak was composed and sealed by the King of Armenia, because the naharars (lords) were considered to be his vassals. Naharar thrones (gahs, i.e. the positions at the royal court) were changing rarely and were inherited from father to son. Only in special circumstances - such as high treason, cessation of the family etc. - the king had the right to make some changes in the Gahnamak. The sequence and classification of Armenian lords'' thrones had been defined and observed from the ancient times. According to the Arab chronologist Yacoubi (the 9th century) there were 113 lords in the administrative province of Arminiya, whereas another Arab historian, Yacout al-Hamavi (the 12-13th centuries) the number of Armenian principalities was 118.',

'This institution was a resurrection of the court of Old Armenia, several locations there were in fact named after the royal council such as Verin Dvin located near the ruins of the ancient city of Dvin, as well as Verin Artashat, Verin Getashen and Verin Javakhk. It served as the council of nobles in early Cilician Armenia before being replaced byt the SUpreme Court.',
'A continuation of the Verin it was the council of nobles that examined government policies and the legal codes, helped to run the state and economy and also acted in some military functions such as running the militias and garrisons so important to defence against the Muslims.',
'Mkhitar Gosh (1130–1213) was the first man to develop a law code for the kingdom he was an Armenian scholar and priest. He wrote a code of laws including civil and Canon law that was used in both Greater Armenia and Cilicia. It was also used in Poland, by order of king Sigismund the Old, as the law under which the Armenians of Lviv and Kamianets-Podilskyi lived from 1519 until the region fell under Austrian rule in 1772. He also wrote a number of popular fables. He founded the monastery of Nor-Getik which since his death has become known better as Goshavank. The works of Mkhitar Gosh were later adapted into a Datastanagirk'' codex in Middle Armenian, which was prepared by Sempad the Constable, an Armenian noble, military commander, and judge in the 13th century.',

'Ecumene (also spelled œcumene or oikoumene) is a term originally used in the Greco-Roman world to refer to the inhabited earth (or at least the known part of it). The term derives from the Greek οἰκουμένη (oikouménē, the feminine present middle participle of the verb οἰκέω, oikéō, "to inhabit"), short for οἰκουμένη γῆ "inhabited world". In the medieval Byzantine period the Romans used it to refer to their sphere of influence and the potential trading points beyond the borders of their control.',
'Kommerkion in the Byzantine Empire, was a commercial tax of 10 % raised in currency on the value of the sold goods (import, export and circulation). This ten procent is a common standard for most cultures throughou the Middle AGes, in Northern Europe it was synonymous with the tithe, a word for tax in general that was derived from the words ''tenth deal'' or tenth part. The difference between Byzantine taxationa dn trade compared with other countries and realms was that the Byzantines had a thousand years of experience in bureaucracy and enforcing governmental regulations. The innate wealth of the Empire and its lands drew traders from very far away and it is they perhaps more than others who had to be controlled and customs duries exacted upon- at the same time, trade had to be nurtured rather than placed under draconian law. The Kommerkion referred not only to the legal systems, but to the actual trade network and populations of guilds, merchants and customers.',
'(Chrysos = gold and bulla = seal) referred to the Imperial documents that were sent out from the palace. In the particualr context of trade, the Chrysobullos was an imperial document, an act granting trade rights for a specific people in a specific area allowed to trade in speciifc goods- the freedoms were naturally controlled and regulated but it allowed enough of an enticement and protection to foreign traders that the issue of this decree was a win/win sitaution for all involved and was a highly sought-after diplomatic prize. Among the ''winners'' in the commerical sector of the Byzantine Oikoumene were the Latins- which included the Franks and to a lesser extent the Iberians but more commonly referred to the mass populations of north Italian merchants that came to such great power in the Middle Ages. Constantinople itself housed over 60,000 Pisan and Genoan merchants at one point and although they were very unpopular with the locals the actual cash that changed hands between these foriegners and the state made the trouble worthwhile.',
'Originally a senatorial collection of donations, it was later levied on the curatorial class as a form of poll tax and in later years could be used as a price for political power in the senate, allowing even foreigners the ability to gain legitimacy and a form of nobility. ',
'Literally ‘great payers’ were those taxpayers who represented not merely the great nobility but the great trading companies and banks where vast sums changed hands. Originally a social status dating back to Justinian usually applied to foreign vassals, the term became common for the gentry- foreign or otherwise in the whole range of Themata across the Empire.',
'Local tax derived from fishing rights. Fishing was a very large part of the medieval economy from Iceland to Aden, not surprisingly around the vast cities of the Mediterranean such as Constantinople the foodsource was a massive aspect of the market. During the 1400s, taxation alone on fishing rights gave an annual income of 10,000 hyperpata almost 15% of the entire tax income of the whole city.',
'Public amenities tax, for use in building and maintaining public baths, gardens, roads, bridges and state offices.',
'Purpose-built, state controlled grain exchange, unpopular Imperial depot. Despite the majority of state-run grain silos being intended for the stability of the local economy and the protection of communal wealth from crime, the state grain exchange was a real betrayal of that system and allowed the state to take advantage of the grain supplies it had acquired from the local community and use it for its own purposes- mainly trade and export or feeding its soldiers.',
'Citadels’ similar to the concept of kastra, notable during the Pecheneg Wars as a centre of refuge. These military outposts imroved law and order since they allowed a better governance over the population, as well as potential enemies. The cost for these defensive structures was considerable but the bonuses to the military echelon in the region was considerable.',
'The Agora was the very heart of the city since Greek times, not only was it the most common place for public gathering, it was a large square where military drills were performed and was typically used as a market square. It was a bustling place of people from all walks of life, and here was the original cultural ''forum'' or official assembly. Over time therefore, the Agora had commercial and administrative meaning, its power in Byzantine culture meant that it was a very open public office of the city assembly.',
'The state regarded the guilds (called systemata in the Book of the Prefect) as an instrument of control and fiscal apportionment. But these guilds acted principally as representatives of their members, providing mutual help and a very swift development and corporation of the various guilds into merchant houses and growing exporters.',
'This was the main privilege remaining to members of the Byzantine systemata, the fact that their merchandise was in demand from both sides, east and west: Constantinople still remained the primary destination for all commerce. In Byzantine Constantinople, the functions of the merchant and the artisan were frequently and commonly blended together. ... and those "who did not labor, such as the importers of fabric from Syria," who belonged to the systemata. In general, however, the individualistic marks of the Byzantine village community seem to have predominated. The Byzantine system of guilds and crafts, somateia or systemata, were extremely good with trade but in time it became clear that they did not have the organisation and aggressive focus of acquisitions that the Italians had- and despite the Byzantine system being very efficicient for a Greek and Anatolian market- beyond its borders it was challenged.',
'A bouleuterion was a building which housed the council of citizens (boule) in Ancient Greece. There are several extant remains of Bouleuterions around Greece and former Greek territories of ancient times. The boule, a basic institution of the ancient city-state in historical times, consisted of the citizens'' representatives who assembled in order to confer and decide about public affairs. In Byzantine Greece the instituion continued as a city assembly with direct commercial law contact with the Agora.',

'In the Byzantine times the sakellion of the emperor kept records of imperial monasteries and their property. Therefore the sakellarios was also an administrative title. In particular the Sacellarius or Megas Sakellarios (Great Sakellarios) was in fact the finance minister of the Byzantine Empire. Etymologically the word derives from the Latin sacellus, a purse [for coins]. Note that the Modern Greek word sakoula, bag, has the same origin. The Byzantine Empire was the legal heir of the Roman Empire and its founder, Constantine the Great, was a Roman. Thus, the official in charge of the emperor’s (empire’s) pouch, i.e., the treasury, was the Sacellarius. As monasteries also have treasuries, the title is also found in the Greek Orthodox Church hierarchy. In later years the title was replaced by that of the Grand Treasurer (Megas Thysaurofylax); however it remained unaltered in the Ecumenical Patriarchate’s structure and in the Synod of Ferrara-Florence (1438-9) that was supposed to unify the Greek Orthodox and the Catholic churches.',
'A kentron or centre was an important administrative office of a treasury chamber. This Chamber was not responbile for keeping records of all tax returns, but in auditing the local ecclesiarchy they had perfect means to control the Church and its assets for political beenfit. The office also had full access to Church records giving them total control over birth, marriage and death records- naturally helping them in their taxation system.',
'Office of the Table was a privy council, overseeing the city assembly, the chancellory and the merchant guids and producers. It represented the highest level of government.',
'The themes or themata (Greek: θέματα; singular θέμα, thema) were the main administrative divisions of the middle Byzantine Empire. They were established in the mid-seventh century in the aftermath of the Muslim conquests of Byzantine territory and replaced the earlier provincial system established by emperors Diocletian and Constantine the Great. In their origin, the first themes were created from the areas of encampment of the field armies of the East Roman army, and their names corresponded to the military units they had resulted from. The theme system reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries, as older themes were split up and the conquest of territory resulted in the creation of new ones. The original theme system underwent significant changes in the 11th and 12th centuries, but the term remained in use as a provincial and financial circumscription, until the very end of the Empire. The term thema was ambiguous, referring both to a form of military tenure and to an administrative division. A theme was an arrangement of plots of land given for farming to the soldiers. The soldiers were still technically a military unit, under the command of a strategos, and they did not own the land they worked as it was still controlled by the state. Therefore, for its use the soldiers'' pay was reduced. By accepting this proposition, the participants agreed that their descendants would also serve in the military and work in a theme, thus simultaneously reducing the need for unpopular conscription as well as cheaply maintaining the military. It also allowed for the settling of conquered lands, as there was always a substantial addition made to public lands during a conquest.',

'Literally ''Noble House'' this represents the formal adoption of the foreign nobility into Armenian power, and the embryonic establishment of the combined Cypriot and Armenian kingdom. Historically, the island was conquered in 1191 by King Richard I of England during the Third Crusade, from Isaac Comnenus, an upstart local governor and self-proclaimed emperor claiming the Byzantine Empire. Richard then sold it to the Knights Templar, who in turn sold it to Guy of Lusignan, jure uxoris King of Jerusalem, in 1192 after the failure of Richard''s crusade and when Guy was dispossessed of his late wife''s kingdom. His brother and successor, Amalric I of Cyprus, received the royal crown and title from Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Since Cyprus''s capture during the Third Crusade in the twelfth century, and receiving predominantly Frankish refugees from the Fall of Acre in 1291- the population of Cyprus was very authorityd by the French, long before the Lusignans. Of course, there were also the other nationalities of marooned Europeans, Byzantines and Armenians, who had made a life for themselves hoping for a return to the Levant to reclaim past glories. In 1342, Levon''s cousin Guy de Lusignan, was anointed king as Constantine II, King of Armenia. Guy de Lusignan and his younger brother John were considered pro-Latin and deeply committed to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church in the Levant. As kings, the Lusignans attempted to impose Catholicism and the European ways. The Armenian nobles largely accepted this, but the peasantry opposed the changes, which eventually led to civil strife.Sis to the Mamluks in 1374 and the fortress of Gaban in 1375, as a result, 30,000 wealthy Armenians left Cilicia and settled in Cyprus, still ruled by the Lusignan dynasty until 1489.',
'This represents the summons of nobles from Europe, particularly from the Lusignan home territories and the crusader Latin Kingdom in Greece. Cyprus was already well-populated with men of Frankish and European ancestry from the 1200s, many of whom still claimed tenuous titles of authority and nobility inherited from the fallen Kingdom of Jerusalem. With the Turkish, Mongol and Mamluk encroachment upon Cilicia, Armenian nobles were also flocking to the island. The independent Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus, with its own archbishop and subject to no patriarch, was allowed to remain on the island, but the Latin Church largely displaced it in stature and holding property. This meant that much like the old Kingdom of Jerusalem that both Armenia and the newly formed Kingdom of Cyprus had ambitions to reclaim, there was a very mixed and multi-cultural society.',
'The French Palace was the formal establishment of Lusignan rule on Cyprus, it allowed proper recognition and pedigree to the title of king or ''Basileus'' as the rulers styled themselves, and gave authority and power to the government.',
'The Table of Honour was a form of royal council made up of the King''s closest men. More specifically it was also the foundation of a sort of Arthurian ''Round Table'', where the chosen men of the newly formed Order of the Sword, with the king as its grandmaster- convened for military purposes.',
'Just like the financial court on which it was based in the fallen Kingdom of Jerusalem, this institution was particualry effective -and indeed neccessary- to regulate the massive trade flowing between east and west. With the myriad of faiths and peoples upon the island of Cyprus notwithstanding the various tongues- a financial tribunal which brought all the merchants together strengthened the trust foreigners had in the state, and more happily came from afar to set up shop and in time develop colonies here.',
'The Chamber of Accounts was a natural extension of both the financial court and the royal council. The kingdom''s government was governed and its finances overseen here. It enabled the economy to grow and to maintain a steady balance.',
'Representation of the Armenian subjects on Cyprus was initially quite poor. The Kingdom of Jerusalem on which the entire Cypriot state was built had a Syrian Court, in turn this Cypriot institution was an attempt to pacify the Armenian community and to integrate Armenian noble power and tradition into the predominantly Frankish culture. It was also a useful means to regulate and control the Armenian population.',
'The High Court was the apex of Cypriot government, a formal parliament with a heavily centralised authority: the king. It encouraged foreign affairs and recieved diplomats, ambassadors and enacted all the laws of the kingdom.',
'With trade as the age-old driving force of the Crusades, and with the Kingdom of Cyprus being fundamentally a Crusader kingdom with fierce ambitions upon Jerusalem the western traders -especially the Italians- were the lifeblood of the entire realm. To control taxation, tarrifs and tolls as well as giving fair representation to all the traders and merchants, the Cour Mer was intrinsically connected with the Cour Fond and all the arms of the state.',

'Duty, service; for peasants, labour obligation (corvée). In the eleventh-twelfth centuries, the peasants in Georgia discharged two basic duties - to the state (a tax) and to their lord fa feudal rent). The state (Crown-) duty consisted of an income-tax, labour-duty and a tax in favour of state-officials. The taxes were paid in kind and in cash. One of the duties was, as we have already mentioned, labour-rent. In the eleventh-twelfth centuries, this duty was called "samushao" (labour). But this purely Georgian word is rarely found in the records: as a rule, labour-rent was called by the Persian term "begara" (or the Arab "sukhra").Further, labour-rent included the mandatory participation of peasants in the lord''s hunt. The labour-rent of the peasants to their lord and to the Crown'' (state) was extremely diversified. In addition to field-work, the peasants were drawn into construction and served their lords as servants and artisans.',
'An obligation paid by peasants to lords, usually to 10 to 25 percent of the grain harvest. A basic form of feudal rent was duty paid in kind, the main part of which consisted of land-tax: grain ("gala") and vine or wine ("kulukhi"). The share of duty paid in kind gradually grew in Georgia in the tenth-eleventh centuries and this, naturally, indicates the growth of feudal exploitation. Duty paid in kind had to be paid by the peasant-"pudze", which in feudal Georgia was also a fiscal unit, but on account of the primitiveness of agricultural implements, the size of the harvest had to be taken into account, although the size of the tax depended on the "good will" of the landowner. According to a document dating from the close of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century, the land-tax amounted to one-fourth of the harvest. The peasant had to bring his feudal lord gifts on the occasion of marriage, the birth of an heir, in the event of death, and on important Christian holidays (Easter, Christmas and so forth). The quitrent included the duty of the peasant to provide the king, the feudal lord or the higher clergy and their suite, with food and lodging and render other services when they stopped at their village.',
'The right of Georgian peasants to petition the king for justice. This was one of the few ''returns'' reciprocating feudal agreement from the lords to the peasantry. This ''power'' of the people emerged from the large agricultural yeild rates of the Georgian homelands compared to neighbouring states, which in turn allowed such a disproportionately high tax rate (double anything recorded in the medieval world.) One of the principal Georgian ploughing implements, the "erkvani", underwent considerable improvement - the large Georgian plough, the "gtani", appeared. The "gutani" enabled the peasant to plough the land deeper than the "erkvani" and to work relatively hard soil. As a result, there was a substantial growth of labour-productivity. The large Georgian plough was used mainly in the lowland-regions of Kartli, where it was well adapted to the prevailing natural conditions. From eight to ten pairs of oxen were harnessed to it. In every large village in lowland-Kartli there were between eight and ten heavy ploughs, each of which was the common property of several families. In addition to the large plough, various types of light ploughs, for instance, the "achacha", were in use in individual regions of Georgia. So the strength, economic and organisational of the small village communities to run the gutani plough system and give good harvests and taxes to the king, enabled them in turn to receive benefits in return.',
'The obligation of a Georgian peasant to his lord equal to 25 percent of the grape harvest or wine output. A basic form of feudal rent was duty paid in kind, the main part of which consisted of land-tax: grain ("gala") and vine or wine ("kulukhi").

'Land granted in hereditary tenure.',
'The 11th century was a high point in Georgian feudalism. The Sakargavi system was characterized by officially decreed relationship between personal ties and the possession of a territory whereby some lands were given for life (sakargavi), other in relationship between personal ties and the occupation of a territory (mamuli). The latter gradually replaced the former and land gradually changed from conditional to hereditary tenure, a process completed only at the end of the 15th century. Yet, a hereditary transmission of a holding remained dependent on the vassal''s relationship with his lord.',
'In dealing with the Georgian nobility, the Bagratid kings of Georgia utilized many of the same methods as did foreign rulers: circumvention of the dynasts whenever possible, manipulation of the nobles'' precedence, and "de-naxararization"--removal of the lords. During the 10-12th centuries, Georgian monarchs attempted to circumvent the autochtonous dynastic nobility by elevating to official positions, persons of non-noble origin. So many non-nobles (uaznoni) were thus elevated to noble status (aznauroba) that in the 11th century Georgian sources a new term, aghzeebulni ("the raised") appeared to designate this growing body. On the military front, the monarchs attempted to circumvent powerful Georgian dynasts by relying on foreign mercenaries (Caucasian mountaineers, Qipchaq Turks, Russians), the lesser nobility, and the increasingly influential Armenian emigre element. The availability of non-noble and foreign elements probably gave the Georgian Bagratids more leverage in dealing with dynasts than had been the case in Bagratid Armenia. Apparently Georgian monarchs also were able to manuipulate precedence among the nobles more advantageously than their Armenian cousins. Occupancy of the office of commander-in-chief of the army (the amirspasalarate) illustrates this. Throughout much of the 12th century to 1155, the amirspasalars tended to be chosen from the mighty, rebellious Georgian branch of the Orbeleans. In the 1120''s the Crown tried to counter Orbelean authority by advancing the Abulet''isjes; and in the 1130''s the Armenian Kiwrikean Bagratids. In 1155 king David V tried to check the Orbeleans'' power by removing them from the amirspasalarate and giving that office to the Orbeleans'' principal Georgian rivals, the Abulet''isjes, to whom other important duties had been given. Orbeleans, however, poisoned the king and regained the office, but after amirspasalar Iwane Orbeli''s abortive revolt in 1176-77, the office was given to a Qipchaq Turk named Qubasar. In 1184, the Gamrekelis were eievated to the amirspasalarate, and several years later the Armenized Kurdish family of Zak''arean/Mxargrceli. Thus prior to the advent of the Zak''arids, the monarch was able to manipulate precedence by rewarding of office, although from the above it should be clear that the struggle against the dynasts was a continuous ongoing contest. The monarch could never rest or relax vigilance.',
'Landed estate; private property of the Tavadi. Satavado (Georgian: სათავადო) was a large feudal political unit in XV-XVIII centuries in Georgia. Satavados were established in times of political and economical upheaval, by exploitation of peasants and the rising diplomatic immunity of feudal lords as they formed a new class of Tavadi (Georgian: თავადი). The long period of domination by foreign invaders had weakened the central political and economic power, which became the main reason for the rise of Satavados. The regions lost economical interrelations, allowing feudal anarchy to grow in the country. Weak monarchs could not carry out their main functions – to keep safe feudal order in the country. Satavados were created by unions of feudal families (union by oath). Powerful feudal lords, unified in Satavado were known to seize royal territories or were granted with the power to manage such territories. They obeyed the Aznauri (nobles) and created their own government offices independently of the King. When Georgia was united (XI-XIII centuries ) the country became strong economically and socially, royal authority was all-encompassing and when the king was strong room for such feudal institutes did not exist. Manorial estates were created over long periods, they included granted, awarded, dowry and captured estates. Part of Satavado was created on the basis of Saeristavo. (Such as Ksani, Aragvi, Racha and others). In Satavado three kind of land hold forms existed: 1) Common or cooperative (Georgian: საერთო) 2) Princely property (Georgian: საუფლისწულო) 3) Individually-owned (Georgian: სათავისთაო)',
'The great war against the Seljuk Turks was a test for the Georgian nation’s strength. For the Georgian people to consolidate their struggle against the invaders the country had to undergo fundamental social, political, economic and cultural changes. And indeed, there was not a single social stratum in Georgia that was not affected by the King David’s reforms. David IV was keen to protect the interests of mdabiuri (military) who bore the heaviest burden of fight against the Seljuk. He established a state land reserve based on holdings directly held by the king (sakhaso), so he could grant temporary land lots to his loyal military and civil servants. The king appropriated the lands of the king of Ereti-Kakheti and the Emir of Tbilisi, and the former Seljuk holdings in Kartli and southwest of Georgia. The king also appropriated some land in Armenia and Shirvan. The feudal ideology of that time was very strict about the divine origin and limitlessness of monarchical power. Its Georgian champions preached that the power was given to the king by God, so the king’s rule was the divine will. Therefore anyone daring to stand against the king’s power would stand against God.',
'Georgians do not call themselves Georgians but Kartvelebi and their land Sakartvelo. These names are derived from a pagan god called Kartlos, said to be the father of all Georgians. The foreign name Georgia, used throughout Western Europe, is mistakenly believed to come from the country’s patron saint, St George. Actually it is derived from the name s Kurj or Gurj, by which they are known to the Arabs and modern Persians. St George himself is a very popular saint among the Georgians but in many local traiditions has continued the powers of earlier pagan deities. “St. George”, who is himself a powerful deity watching over hunters, warriors, and men in general. Readers unfamiliar with traditional Georgian religion are advised to bear in mind that the terms for “icon” (xat’i) and “cross” (Jvari) in the lexicon of Georgian Orthodoxy are curiously polysemous in mountaineer usage, denoting either the object, the shrine enclosing it, or even the deity of which it is a manifestation. “The treasure of the Land of Kajis” (Kajavetis ganzi). A widespread North Eastern Georgian myth recounts how Giorgi (St. George), accompanied by a legendary shaman, descended to the subterranean kingdom of the Kajis, a race of demonic blacksmiths with wondrous powers. He defeats the demons, lays waste to their castle, and returns bearing booty which will be used to establish the central institutions of human society: religion and marriage. Among the riches stolen from the Kajis are the metal vessels used for brewing and drinking consecrated beer, cattle to be used for sacrifice, and the hearth chain symbolically linking the earthly community to heaven. Giorgi also brings three women back with him as his fictive sisters (dobilni), one of whom, Samdzimari, is elevated to the status of his divine consort and female double “Giorgi and Samdzimari are one, one xvtissvili.” Sjulzed c’amqdarni refers to the reversion of usually highland tribes to pagan cults. It is not known whether all of these cults and traditions were actually folk survivals from pre-christian times, or a form of paganism that emerged from Christian mythology.',
'Traditionally, the Jvari shrine was also the centre for rendering justice – the specially gathered council of “counselor-chiefs” pronounced verdicts on religious issues as well as serious intra- clan disputes. Here were resolved the most urgent and important problems concerning the clans – both internal and foreign affairs, including the issues of peace and war. According to tradition, the army of highlanders would never go to war without the blessing of Jvari priests: the mk’adre (medium) and kadag (shaman), who alone are authorized to speak in the name of the deity. While the semi-christian priests of these holy sites were expected to maintain a high degree of purity, traditional shamans and mediums carried this restriction to the point of fanaticism; some individuals never married (like Christian priests), and took extraordinary pains to avoid any sort of contact with women and other potential sources of pollution.The deity known as Lashari is one of the most powerful figures of traditional East-Georgian highland religion, besides Lasharis Jvari, the main shrine of Pshavi, sanctuaries bearing his name are found in Tusheti and Tianeti.',
'Human community living around the shrine. Typically festivals occurred at these communities, like those at Gogolaurt which began with a special gathering of the Baghiauri clan (of which the tavqevisberi is the head) to present offerings and the sacrifice of a ram and bull at their family Mak’alatia shrine next to the ruined fortress Jigrault-Cixe. This ceremony only takes every ten years or so, and is intended to expiate the treacherous slaying, alleged to have occurred many generations earlier, of the Ingush artisan who built the fortress. The complex Seroba festival at Udzilaurt begins with the commemoration of a mythic stone-throwing contest between the divinized hero K’op’ala and man-eating ogres (devebi), who once resided at Cixetgori across the Ak’usho valley from Iremtk’alo mountain. The contest ended when K’op’ala, standing at the site of the sanctuary atop Iremtk’alo, slung a gigantic boulder across the valley to Cixetgori, where it crushed the ogres’ fortress and put them to flight. For his strength and valor in defeating the devebi, thereby making the territory of Pshavi safe for human habitation, K’op’ala and his companions Iaqsari and P’irkushi were transformed into xvtissvilni (pagan deities) by the Christian God, and each was granted a fief (saq’mo) in Pshavi: Udzilaurt, Kist’aurt and Goderdzault communes.',
'The sites of shrines are believed to have selected by the xvtissvilni gods themselves. The height of sacredness is concentrated in the k’vrivi, the site where a deity is said to have touched down. A tower built on such a spot near the village of Matura, to give one example, is held in such awe that even the priest cannot cross the wall encircling it. In order to sprinkle the tower with the blood of an animal sacrificed in the name of the community, the priest throws blood-soaked snowballs against its walls. Radiating outward from the k’vrivi are spaces of lesser sacredness, to which increasingly larger groups of people have access.',
'The central motif of the ballads in the Zurab cycle is the role of the sacred oak trees (bermuxa) standing in the precincts of the chief shrines of Pshavi and Xevsureti. All attempts to break the resistance of the mountaineers failed until a traitor revealed the secret of the trees to Zurab. Both trees were believed to be linked to heaven by invisible golden chains. Zurab was instructed to spill the blood of a cat — an unclean animal — on the bermuxa, which thereupon forced the deity to flee heavenward, taking his chain with him. Deprived of their divine protector, the trees were cut down, and the mountaineers were defeated in battle. (Fortunately, according to the legend, new cultic centers sprung up to replace those destroyed by Zurab, and the highlanders finally prevailed).',
'Some local shrines and their patron deities are associated with “brotherhoods” (sazmo) of neighboring families who belong to different clans. These families also worship at their clanic shrines, resulting in a complex interweaving of saq’moebi, reflecting both descent groups in the strict sense and residence patterns. At the ideological level, however, the whole theological and social architecture remains based on kinship alone, since the sazmo, as its name indicates, creates a quasi-familial relationship (it one of several forms of fictive kin alliance in use in the Caucasus).',
'A well-attended Festival of the Archangel was recorded at Omalo, including scenes of the brewing of ritual beer and components of the sanctuary: the candle-altar and a middle-sized stone tower (which the locals call “milionai”), believed to be the throne of the patron deity, hay-mowing and rug-weaving, and religious festival at the nearby village Diklo, where a dry-built stone “milionai” is situated. A very interesting ritual is recorded in the village Kumelauri: after the festival drunk riders heading for the village are blocked by women armed with long sticks who try to throw them off their horses. Although tinged with humour it clearly has pagan symbolism.',
'Tsikhe were literally fortresses, however in the religious sense these were often linked to ancient pagan sites which in turn had been great settlements and regional capitals. In time many of these sites had devolved into simple vaillage communities, yet stone towers were often built here in medieval times with succinctly religious and not defensive interests. These towers often represented the ''pillars of the earth'' a concept seen in many religious traidtions including Christian churches and their steeples ''reaching to heaven''. One such site was Zaden-tsikhe (ზადენციხე), i.e., "the fortress of Zaden" of the medieval Georgian chronicles. This fortress and a possible pagan temple was overlooked by Mount Zedazeni ("Upper Zaden") where later a Christian monastery was built. The name of the city and its dominant acropolis, Armaz-Tsikhe (literally, "citadel of Armazi"; არმაზციხე), is usually taken to derive from Armazi, the chief deity of the pagan Iberian pantheon. The name first appears in the early medieval Georgian annals though it is clearly much older and reflected in the Classical name Armastica or Harmozica of Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy and Dio Cassius which may have links with Zorostrianism.',

'Loosely related to the tagmata, and often included among them, were the Noumeroi (Gr. Νούμεροι, from the Latin numerus, "number") they were a garrison unit for Constantinople, which probably included the original Teichistai (Gr. Τειχισταί) or tōn Teicheōn regiment (Gr. τῶν Τειχέων, "of the Walls"), manning the Walls of Constantinople. The unit''s origins may lie as far back as the 4th–5th centuries. WIth the development of the Byzantine army in the Middle Ages, taking much of the lost Golden Age and trying to mirror this throughout the military- the once elite regiments were names and terms applied now to basic regiments- much in the same way as great Imperial titles once held rare priviledge but were now given to all kinds of men. With the fall of Constantinople, the Walls Regiment had already lost significance and was the standard organisation of the regional garrisons.',
'Retinue guards, although earlier the officers of the vestiaritai were given the lofty court title of sebastos and two of their number, Andronikos Lampardas and Alexios Petraliphas, were prominent generals -the concept of these elite guards waned into a less highly status regiment. The sebastokrator Isaac, brother of John II, was one of the first to maintain his own unit of vestiaritai guards that were not of the older high status. As the Empire developed and in reaction to many historical events such as the infiltration of more and more foreigners into the Byzantine elite regiments, particularly the loss of Constantinople left the Imperial Guards with a less than stellar reputation. The distinction between the Oikeioi (Great Household troops) and the Vestiaritai is not clear, especially in the early medieval period. The Oikeioi had become the retinue knights of Byzantium in the eyes of European ''Latin'' culture. Rather quickly however the Vestiaritai appear as guarding public amentities and treasuries, and numerous other urban centres.',
'City takers'' (siege engines) were called Helepolis from the phrase ''capturing cities''- Elein poleis. The first Helepolis was an ancient siege engine invented by Polyidus of Thessaly and improved by Demetrius I of Macedon and Epimachus of Athens for the unsuccessful siege of Rhodes, based on an earlier, less massive design used against Salamis (305–304 BC). The actual siege engine was a monument to Greek engineering- an abosulte monster of the battlefield, 130 feet high, and 65 feet wide it rested on eight wheels, each 12 feet high. More than a mere seige tower, it packed two 180-pound (82 kg) catapults, and one 60-pounder (27 kg) (classified by the weight of the projectiles they threw) on the first floor, three 60-pounders (27 kg) on the second, and two 30-pounders (14 kg) on each of the next five floors. The word therefore entered the Greek language as an archetype of military engineering.',

'Major farming institutions, the ''economy'' was dependent not only on mere agriculture but the administration and taxation system which governed provinces and guaranteed the transferral of profits to the central government (Constantinople). This was a major foundation for the entire social network.',
'Under the Palaeologans, pronoiars (estate owners) could more easily be organized into military units if the emperor required their service. The emperor could also confiscate their revenues for whatever reason. Andronicus II Palaeologus, for example, used the money raised by the pronoiars to finance military expeditions against the Bulgarians, but he did not require them to provide military service themselves. During this time pronoiars could also attract followers by giving them pronoia grants of their own. Recruiting pronoiars to form an army helped unite the remnants of the empire after 1261. However, there were by this time only a few thousand pronoiars, and although they paid for their own expenses, the emperors could not afford a full army or navy to strengthen the empire''s defenses. The impoverished empire had very little tax revenue, and pronoiars began to extract rents from the paroikoi, turning back to the old Thema system. The empire continued to lose land to the Ottoman Empire, and Constantinople was finally lost in 1453, but the Ottomans continued to use their own version of the pronoia system, called the timar system, which they had borrowed from the Byzantines during their conquests.',
'By the 11th century, Byzantine aristocrats had ceased to hold any significant power, clinging instead to the honorific titles they held by virtue of being related to the ruling emperor. These were often used to bid for power within the government, sometimes at as high a level as the throne itself. By the reign of Constantine IX in the middle part of the century they had also begun to assert sovereignty over various parts of the empire, collecting taxes for themselves and often plotting rebellions against the emperor. In the late 11th century Alexius I attempted to reform the aristocracy, taking the pacifying measure of distributing Byzantine territory amongst its members. Doing so had the added benefit of removing them from Constantinople, making it harder for them to directly challenge the emperor''s authority. Most pronoiai granted by Alexius, however, were to members of his own (Comnenus) family. Alexius simply legitimized the holding of land by aristocrats, and brought it under centralized state control.',

'Despite the continuous growth of the Byzantine economy during the 9th and the 10th centuries, in the middle of the 11th century successive devaluations of the coinage occurred: it is very likely that they are evidence of a recession along with a new economic austerity in the field of public finance. Researchers of economic history in this period point out that one of the reasons behind this austerity was the defective system of tax collection. One measure of the shortfall in collection has to do with the exkousseia. The term exkousseia is a Hellenized version of the Latin term excusatio (release). It was used to describe a system of tax exemptions, which although first appearing in the 10th century, were put into broad effect in the 11th century. This institution included preferential exemptions from certain taxes, most likely from the epereiai, angariai (forced public works) and leitourgiai (forced public services). The exkousseiai were granted to possessors or administrators of several financial means that entailed tax obligations: land, paroikoi, ships, buildings, animals. They were often conceded by the Emperor himself to individuals (not collectively to social groups as in the case of the early Byzantine excusatio) and were intended to strengthen client relationships. The people most favoured by the exkoussiai were the clergy and charitable institutions. Also favoured were some subjects of the Empire who had undertaken to provide services to the state: the families of soldiers of the Themes (due to their property being liable to the strateia) as well as subjects who had undertaken to feed and provision the horses of the state postal services and to maintain the postal stations. All those who enjoyed the exkousseiai were called exkoussatoi. In the cases of the local ruling houses or certain regions, the exkousseiai entitled the vassal to a good deal of freedom whose obvious economical effects strengthened the likelihood of loyalty from the province, which after all for the medieval Byzantines was one of their greatest challenges.',
'Minor Regional Chieftaincy. In the late Byzantine Empire, the term kephalē (Greek: κεφαλή, "head") was used to denote local and provincial governors. It entered use in the second half of the 13th century, and was derived from the colloquial language. Consequently it never became an established title or rank of the imperial hierarchy, but remained a descriptive term. In essence, the kephalē replaced the Komnenian-era doux as the civil and military governor of a territorial administrative unit, known as a katepanikion, but also termed a kephalatikion or ''head province''.',
'Military fortress, the kephalē''s seat was an establishment of his rule and power. It was in some ways a dangerous standard of personal freedom and show of strength by the Imperial vassals. However, whilst kept under the Emperor''s rule, they greatly reinforced the efficiency both military and administrative of the governor''s authority.',

'In the 14th century, superior kephalai were appointed (katholikai kephalai, "universal heads") overseeing a group of provinces under their respective [merikai] kephalai ("[partial] heads"). The former were usually kin of the emperor or members of the senior aristocratic clans. With the increasing decentralization of the Empire and the creation of appanages in the form of semi-independent despotates, these posts vanished by the late 14th century.',

'Atashgah, literally ''place of the fire'' in which the actual fire-altar stands. A temple at which a Yasna service (the principal Zoroastrian act of worship that accompanies the recitation of the Yasna liturgy) may be celebrated will always have, attached to it or on the grounds, at least a well or a stream or other source of ''natural'' water. This is a critical requirement for the Ab-Zohr, the culminating rite of the Yasna service. Only priests attached to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed on at least one side and has a double domed roof.',
'Atashkada, a Classical Persian language term that together with its middle Persian predecessors (atash-kadag, -man and -xanag) literally means ''house of fire''. The oldest remains of what has been identified as a fire-temple are those on Mount Khajeh, near Lake Hamun in Sistan. Only traces of the foundation and ground-plan survive and have been tentatively dated to the 3rd or 4th century BCE. The temple was rebuilt during the Parthian era (250 BCE-226 CE), and enlarged during Sassanid times (226–650 CE). The characteristic feature of the Sassanid fire temple was its domed sanctuary where the fire-altar stood. This sanctuary always had a square ground plan with a pillar in each corner that then supported the dome (the gombad). Archaeological remains and literary evidence from Zend commentaries on the Avesta suggest that the sanctuary was surrounded by a passage way on all four sides. "On a number of sites the gombad, made usually of rubble masonry with courses of stone, is all that survives, and so such ruins are popularly called in Fars čahār-tāq or ''four arches''."',
'The Atash Dadgah is the lowest grade of sacred fire, and can be consecrated within the course of a few hours by two priests, who alternatingly recite the 72 verses of the Yasna liturgy. Consecration may occasionally include the recitatation of the Vendidad, but this is optional. A lay person may tend the fire when no services are in progress. The term is not necessarily a consecrated fire, and the term is also applied to the hearth fire, or to the oil lamp found in many Zoroastrian homes.',
'The next highest grade of fire is the Atash Adaran, the "Fire of fires". It requires a gathering of hearth fire from representatives of the four professional groups (that reflect feudal estates): from a hearth fire of the asronih (the priesthood), the (r)atheshtarih (soldiers and civil servants), the vastaryoshih (farmers and herdsmen) and the hutokshih (artisans and laborers). Eight priests are required to consecrate an Adaran fire and the procedure takes between two and three weeks.',
'The highest grade of fire is the Atash Behram, "Fire of victory", and its establishment and consecration is the most elaborate of the three. It involves the gathering of 16 different "kinds of fire", that is, fires gathered from 16 different sources, including lightning, fire from a cremation pyre, fire from trades where a furnace is operated, and fires from the hearths as is also the case for the Atash Adaran. Each of the 16 fires is then subject to a purification ritual before it joins the others. 32 priests are required for the consecration ceremony, which can take up to a year to complete. A temple that maintains an Adaran or Behram fire also maintains at least one Dadgah fire. In contrast to the Adaran and Behram fires, the Dadgah fire is the one at which priests then celebrate the rituals of the faith, and which the public addresses to invoke blessings for a specific individual, a family or an event. Veneration of the greater fires is addressed only to the fire itself — that is, following the consecration of such a fire, only the Atash Nyashes, the litany to the fire in Younger Avestan, is ever recited before it.',
'A Tower of Silence or Dakhma (Persian: دخمه) is a circular, raised structure used by Zoroastrians for exposure of the dead. Zoroastrian tradition considers a dead body—in addition to cut hair and nail-parings—to be nasu, unclean, i.e. potential pollutants. Specifically, the corpse demon (Avestan: nasu.daeva) was believed to rush into the body and contaminate everything it came into contact with, hence the Vendidad (an ecclesiastical code "given against the demons") has rules for disposing of the dead as "safely" as possible. To preclude the pollution of earth or fire (see Zam and Atar respectively), the bodies of the dead are placed atop a tower—a tower of silence—and so exposed to the sun and to birds of prey. Thus, "putrefaction with all its concomitant evils" "is most effectually prevented." The towers, which are fairly uniform in their construction, have an almost flat roof, with the perimeter being slightly higher than the center. The roof is divided into three concentric rings: The bodies of men are arranged around the outer ring, women in the second circle, and children in the innermost ring. Once the bones have been bleached by the sun and wind, which can take as long as a year, they are collected in an ossuary pit at the center of the tower, where—assisted by lime—they gradually disintegrate and the remaining material—with run-off rainwater—runs through multiple coal and sand filters before being eventually washed out to sea.',
'The Farnbag fire translated as ''the fire Glory-Given'' was considered the most venerated because it was seen as the earthly representative of the Atar Spenishta, ''Holiest Fire'' of Yasna 17.11 and described in a Zend commentary on that verse as "the one burning in Paradise in the presence of Ohrmazd." The remains at Takht-i-Suleiman, midway between Urumieh and Hamadan, as the temple of Adur Gushnasp. The location of the Mithra fire, i.e. that of Burzen-Mihr, identified with reasonable certainty at being near the village of Mihr half-way between Miandasht and Sabzevar on the Khorasan road to Neyshabur. The Indian (lesser) Bundahishn records the Farnbag fire having been "on the glory-having mountain which is in Khwarezm" but later moved "upon the shining mountain in the district of Kavul just as it there even now remains"). That the temple once stood in Khwarezm is also supported by the Greater (Iranian) Bundahishn and by the texts of Zadsparam. However, according to the Greater Bundahishn, it was moved "upon the shining mountain of Kavarvand in the Kar district" (the rest of the passage is identical to the Indian edition). Darmesteter identified this ''Kar'' as Kariyan in Pars (Persia proper), "celebrated for its sacred fire which has been transported there from Khvarazm as reported by Masudi"',

'The need to protect the Anatolian heartland of Byzantium from the Arab raids led to the creation, in the later 8th and early 9th centuries, of a series of small frontier districts, the kleisourai or kleisourarchiai ("defiles, enclosures"). The term was previously used to signify strategically important, fortified mountain passages, and was now expanded to entire districts which formed separate commands under a kleisourarchēs, tasked with guerrilla warfare and locally countering small to mid-scale incursions and raids. Gradually, most of these were elevated to full themes. With the beginning of the Byzantine offensives in the East and the Balkans in the 10th century, especially under the warrior-emperors Nikephoros II (r. 963–969), John I Tzimiskes (r.969–976) and Basil II (r. 976–1025), newly gained territories were also incorporated into themes, although these were generally smaller than the original themes established in the 7th and 8th centuries.Most consisted merely of a fortress and its surrounding territory, with a lesser stratēgos as a commander and about 1,000 men as their garrison. In the East, where many were populated or resettled with Armenians, they became known as the "small" (μικρὰ θέματα) or "Armenian" themes (ἀρμενικὰ θέματα), in contrast to the traditional "great" or "Roman" themes (ῥωμαϊκά θέματα)',
'Related to the modern English word ''procedure'' Prosodoi was the basic formation of taxation. When used in a general sense it refers to property taxes and confisactions, but over time the term became more spefic as a widespread poll-tax. Tracing its original concept back to Aristotle, it was the basic procedural command of government in a region. Prosodoi revenues were usually obtained from Ktémata.',
'Small estates with heavy use of slaves, who acted with more freedom as servants and informal family members. This important strata of society were free landowning estate farmers who formed a strong middle class between the workers and the produce from their lands. These ''free lands'' where landowners would mix with whom were tehnically slaves meant that a general form of society abounded in these provinces, where the class systems rules were more fluid and men were judged on their role in the community rather than who owned who. Although this culture was looked down on by the urbanites and the more civilised upper classes, in its context these provincials were in themselves much more efficient at maintaining the peace, and producing large harvests and culls of livestock. The longstanding ''Imperial Peace'' came not from the sword of the army, but from the culture of the subject communities, the cooonies such as in Thrace that lacked this free social system were the ones more likely to be troubled bu civil strife and rebellion.',
'Ktémata was the general term for property and estates, more specifically a lord''s Ktémata would include his paroikoi villeins, his own teams of oxen used for sowing seed and could be bred for meat or hides. It would also include all the property of his vassals particularly the tenant paroikoi and their oxen as well as their harvests, it included the pasture lands under his dominion, the orchards and any range of fruit-bearing tree, it was also documented who many non-fruit bearing trees the lord had which could be used as timber for construction or shipbuilding. Ktémata was well-documented throughout a Themata as it allowed the Empire to keep complete track of its own accumalative wealth, and the waelth of its subjects that could be better taxed, controlled and their assets utilised for the greater good of the Empire.',
'Rhogai refered to state salaries, given to soldier, seaman and of course generals. Within a Thema, rhogai were all the rents, taxes and dues from land tenure and feudal service that were OWING to the lord. As medieval Byzantine governorships became much more territorial and rather feudal, the lords in question would be very focussed on the Thematic rhogai and the actual wealth as well as the debts within his region, they were paid systematically every three or four years but counted out annually. In 809 the Bulgarians captured and seized the Rhogai treasury of one four year period for the Styrmon region, it amounted to well over 10,000 florins. Again in 811 the Arabs captured the Armeniakon with a similar rhogai amount. This tells us that the majority or Thema generated a rhogai of roughly 1500 florins per 6-month period. The amounts of money required to be calculated en masse brought about a system of chancelleries and local tax stations that defined an estate by its rhogai, in a form of equity- estate ownership and noble status were often based on the allotment and quality of their Rhogai. More importantly it was by the division and cataloguing of possessions and asset wealth that taxation and state income as well as the general governorship could be applied much more precisely. The system of offices, administration and bureaucracy in the Byzantine Empire was extremely efficient and in many ways was the very lifeblood of the Empror''s Rule.',

'Mills were a very important asset in the medieval world. Originally developed by the Muslims, watermills were an excellent way of helping irrigation but of also using waterpower to drive mills wheels used in griding grain- an otherwise very long and gruelling job. Mills removed the work of grinding from the labour of the people and in turn produced a steady and very fast flow of grain for bread. Water driven mills were hydrokinéta and animal-driven (drawn by mules) were called zóokinéta. The improvement of rural life and the ability to free workers from this task and allow them to work on other tasks in the fields refined the entire agrciultural process. Increased production could allow the excess to be traded, or stpred for hard times such as winter or famine.',
'Grain silos were a rather technical invention, stockpiling any vegetable substance in the hot climate of Greece or Anatolia would cause the material to rot, spontaneously combust, to yeast or to become infested with insects and rodents. With the improvements of agricultural methods that allowed a large annual harvest production and crop yield not all excess was traded off out of the region- much of it had to be stored to cover the rest of the year when food was harder to come by. Silos were run by the state, the grain tax culled all the excess from the region- the farmers were happy to pay in tax what would otherwise be wasted- and besides within a few months the grain would be sold back to them for their own use. Sorting grain was not within the means of most towns and certainly not within the abilities of small estates. Grain silos employed the Thematic militias in gathering, documenting and then guarding the produce until it was needed during the winter. Small rural silos were often plundered by rival famers or bandits, whereas the large urban silos allowed Imperial protection and an entire administrative system to keep check and to fairly distribute the profits across the community.',

On top of the obvious benefits of allowing more people to attend mass, a Church will attract enough prospective clergymen to be able to afford to spare one as a missionary.',

'While the Perfecti pledged themselves to ascetic lives of simplicity, frugality and purity, Cathar credentes (believers) were not expected to adopt the same stringent lifestyle. They were, however, expected to refrain from eating meat and dairy products, from killing and from swearing oaths. Catharism was above all a populist religion and the numbers of those who considered themselves "believers" in the late 12th century included a sizeable portion of the population of Languedoc, counting among them many noble families and courts. These individuals often drank, ate meat, and led relatively normal lives within medieval society—in contrast to the Perfecti, whom they honoured as exemplars. Though unable to embrace the life of chastity, the credentes looked toward an eventual time when this would be their calling and path.',
'Perfect (also known as a Parfait in French or Perfecti in Latin) was the name given to a monk of the medieval French Christian religious movement commonly referred to as the Cathars. They were expected to follow a lifestyle of extreme renunciation and austerity from the world which included abstaining from eating meat and avoiding all sexual contact. By that virtue they were recognized as trans-material (i.e. spiritualized) angels by their followers, the Credentes (Croyant in French, Believers in English). Perfectii were drawn from all walks of life and counted aristocrats, merchants and peasants among their number. Women could also become Perfects; Female Perfects were known as Parfaites or Perfectae.One of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum (Consolation) to the dying - this ensured admittance of the soul of the deceased to heaven and normally required a request from the recipient to a Perfect for the Consolamentum - this meant that many Perfects would not administer the Consolamentum to those who were beyond reason or sentient speech - as they clearly were not in a position to make the necessary request. One of the conditions of being a Credente was the uttering of the Convanenza, or Covenant, when encountering a Perfect, which involved the request for the Consolamentum should they be dying. This was aimed at enabling the Perfect to bestow the sacrament to those whose illness meant they could not ask for it. The Cathars believed in a doctrine of reincarnation interpreting the idea of Eternal Life promised in the Bible as meaning release from the cycle of successive births in this world, which they believed to be ruled over by Satan. The Consolamentum was thought to purify the soul through the Holy Spirit before death to enable its ascent to Christ. Naturally it was this priesthood, so widespread throughout France, the Low Countries and northern Italy as well as the Bogomil homelands of Thrace that were so heavily persecuted by the conventional Churches of Catholicism and Orthodoxy.',
'An individual entered into the community of Perfecti through a ritual known as the consolamentum, a rite that was both sacramental and sacerdotal in nature: sacramental in that it granted redemption and liberation from this world; sacerdotal in that those who had received this rite functioned in some ways as the Cathar clergy—though the idea of priesthood was explicitly rejected. The consolamentum was the baptism of the Holy Spirit, baptismal regeneration, absolution, and ordination all in one. The ritual consisted of the laying on of hands (and the transfer of the spirit) in a manner believed to have been passed down in unbroken succession from Jesus Christ. Upon reception of the consolamentum, the new Perfectus surrendered his or her worldly goods to the community, vested himself in a simple black or blue robe with cord belt, and sought to undertake a life dedicated to following the example of Christ and his Apostles — an often peripatetic life devoted to purity, prayer, preaching and charitable work. Above all, the Perfecti were dedicated to enabling others to find the road that led from the dark land ruled by the dark lord, to the realm of light which they believed to be humankind''s first source and ultimate end.',
'The term Pays Cathare, French meaning "Cathar Country" is used to highlight the Cathar heritage and history of the region where Catharism was traditionally strongest. Only though a modern term it does have some value as a reference to those homelands of Albigensian Catharism which was so successfual and popular not only in creating its own population of believers but being accepted by its neighbours who particularly in the case of the catholic population Toulouse were ready to fight and die -even as Catholics- to protect these men and women who were called Bons Chretiens: ''Good Christians''.',
'Cathar castles (in French Châteaux cathares) is a modern term used to designate a series of fortresses built by the French king on the southern border of his lands at the end of the Albigensian Crusade. Some of these sites, before the royal period, were fortified villages capable of sheltering Cathars and which were destroyed during the building of citadels. In Languedoc, the only real "Cathar castles" were fortified homesteads (castrum), such as Laurac, Fanjeaux, Mas-Saintes-Puelles. Certain sites like Lastours-Cabaret, Montségur, Termes or Puilaurens were castra before being razed to the ground and becoming royal citadels. The legend of Cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth. The only monuments which witnessed the events of the first half of the 13th century, and therefore the only ones which can claim the description "Cathar", given that the Cathar Church never built anything, are the small castles. Therefore the majority of castles given over to the Cathars- inkeeping with their largely pacifist faith were purely defensive structures where the last vestiges of persecuted ''heretics'' fled from the Catholics. Although the loss in territory to this religious minority involved a loss of land, it did in fact stabilise the outlying regions and enable a form local autonomies that would defend themselves independently from Albigensian Crusaders.',
'The Inquisition was established in 1229 to uproot the remaining Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, Carcassonne and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it finally succeeded in extirpating the movement. Cathars who refused to recant were hanged, or burnt at the stake. From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of Montségur was besieged by the troops of the seneschal of Carcassonne and the archbishop of Narbonne. On 16 March 1244, a large and symbolically important massacre took place, where over 200 Cathar perfects were burnt in an enormous fire at the prat des cramats near the foot of the castle. Moreover, the Church decreed lesser chastisements against laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars, at the 1235 Council of Narbonne. Inquisitors required heretical sympathisers - repentant first offenders - to sew a yellow cross onto their clothes. A popular though as yet unsubstantiated theory holds that a small party of Cathar perfects escaped from the fortress before the massacre at prat des cramats. It is widely held in the Cathar region to this day that the escapees took with them Le Tresor Cathar. What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars'' accumulated wealth made up of the sizeable donations of the converted nobility of the area as well as any property of those that became Perfecti. This ''treasure'' whether material or literary was quite arguably the very impetus that continued to drive the survival of Catharism throughout Europe well into the late Middle Ages where they were seen in the riots and persecutions in as far afield as Russia, the Low Countries and Spain.',

'Usury from Medieval Latin usuria, "interest", or from Latin usura, "interest" originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as investment and capital. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. The term is largely derived from Christian religious principles; Riba is the corresponding Arabic term and ribbit is the Hebrew word. The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury (canon 17). At the time, usury was interest of any kind, and the canon merely forbade the clergy to lend money on interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% APR). Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity. The Third Lateran Council decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor Christian burial. Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury a heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation which allowed it. Pope Sixtus V condemned the practice of charging interest as "detestable to God and man, damned by the sacred canons and contrary to Christian charity." All of this however, had absolutely no application to Jews. The Torah makes a distinction between interest deducted before the loan is handed over and interest deducted afterwards. What is clear – as with so much of the Old Testament – is that many prohibitions applied within the Jewish community did not apply outside. In other words, there was a loophole allowing interest to be charged to gentiles. Nonetheless Talmudic Law confined Jewish interest rates to 20%. With the rise of Templar banking and Italian banking who both had comparatively astronomical interest rates (possibly due to the social constrictions which they had found loopholes through) Jewish banking remained extremely popular due to its fairness. As the Jews were ostracized from most professions by local rulers, the church and the guilds, they were pushed into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending. Natural tensions between creditors and debtors were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Precisely in the same way that the aristoricies and European royal families found themselves indebted to the Templars and thereby conspired their demise, so Jews were pushed out of Europe. In 1275, Edward I of England passed the Statute of Jewry which made usury illegal and linked it to blasphemy, in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to the Crown. In 1290, all Jews were expelled from England, and allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown''s. The usury was cited as the official reason for the Edict of Expulsion. The violence targetted at Jews increased in Europe, no doubt encouraged by the indebted aristocracy. In time Italian bankers won the financial war and their way of doing business transformed European commerce, dragging Europe into the Renaissance.',

'Constructing Ballista Towers atop settlement walls allows a defending force to shower any attackers with iron bolts, a sensible improvement for almost any siege scenario. Any besieging force has to stay beyond range until the moment of their attack, and must then run a terrible gauntlet of missile fire.',
'Guns are a sensible addition to any defence, and Cannon Towers are suitably intimidating to any attacker brave - or foolhardy - enough to come within range. Their massive size is necessary to absorb the tremendous shock of repeated firing and to stand against any enemy guns.',

'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',
'The sheer size of these magnificent defences is enough to awe the peasants who work in their shadow! These walls are extremely costly, but that price guarantees security against all but the most well-prepared besieging force. Thanks to strong towers, battlements and gatehouses, the defenders can make any assault a chancy business.',

'A Port brings trade to a settlement. Indeed, moving goods by water is the only way to carry large cargoes long distances cheaply and thus turn a profit. The need to keep merchant ships in good order also means that the necessary skills to make military vessels can be found here.',
'A Shipwright has the slipway, wood seasoning stores and manpower needed to build ships for a strong fleet. The improved port buildings - and simple improvements like creating permanent wharves along a waterfront - allow more trade to occur.',
'A Dockyard allows the construction of larger ships, and the improved wharves make trade easier to manage. Goods from all over the world pass through the docks, bringing wealth and excitement into the lives of citizens.',
'A Naval Dockyard allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the port to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',

'As the need to move increasing quantities of goods and people throughout a region grows, so too grows the call for proper roads. While there are paths to most every populated place in the known world, when the local ruling class invests in clearing debris and packing the earth to produce lasting Dirt Roads, the benefits in increased troop movement and trade soon become obvious.',

'Land Clearance is the first step on the road to establishing organised farming in the countryside, and ensuring that a region will begin to grow and prosper. Though there is little more to land clearance than deforestation and basic tilling of the soil, any area where the local establishment has not taken such measures to make the land workable will struggle to feed its populace.',
'Communal Farming is the natural progression from land clearance, where the farming communities adopt a system of centralised management. By sharing common resources and transportation, communal farming sees all the individual farms in the community achieve a level of productivity, prosperity and security that would otherwise be unattainable.',
'Crop Rotation is a more advanced farming system that maximises the use of farming districts all year round. Going to the trouble of planting different crops in different seasons not only ensures that something is always growing, varying the produce actually improves the soil quality markedly so as to reap greater harvests all year round.',
'Irrigation represents the final frontier in terms of actively improving farming districts. Water is diverted to crops via a system of man-made channels dug into the earth so as to dramatically improve soil fertility. Although irrigating the land is grand and arduous task, and maintaining proper irrigation is an ongoing job, the benefits from the resulting surplus of food produced make the endeavour well worth it.',

'As traders often have to travel long distances they need somewhere safe to stay. The traders show their appreciation for these places by including the place along their caravan route, bringing extra coin in, and ensuring there’s enough camels about to use them to form specialised cavalry units.',
'To clear a space for caravan traders to stop for a while is one thing, but to actually establish a permanent Caravansary for them is another. The Caravansary is essentially a sort of traveller’s inn, built around a large court where the drivers can ‘stable’ their camels. Any settlement with a Caravansary is a preferred destination for desert trade, greatly increasing the taxable income in the region.',

'The ''tribute in blood'' was the practice by which the Ottoman Empire conscripted boys from Christian families, who were taken from their families and by force converted to Islam, trained and enrolled in one of the four imperial institutions: the Palace, the Scribes, the Religious and the Military. The devşirme system humiliated non-Muslim societies controlled by the Ottomans and was resisted, even to the point of disfiguring their sons. There were however cases of Christian parents bribing officials to take their children. The majority of slaves were acquired from the Balkans, but were also known to be culled from Greeks (Byzantines) and Armenians, Jews however were exempt from this service. The name janissary or janizary derives from the Ottoman Turkish: يكيچرى (yeniçeri) meaning "new regiments", Suleiman I had 165 ortas but the number over time increased to 196. The Sultan was the supreme commander of the Army and the Janissaries in particular. The corps was divided into three main regiments, each Orta or battalion was around 50-100 men. Once the blood-tax was in place children usually from the age of 5 or 6 were then taken into slavery as janissaries for training. Continued construction of this janissary building tree will at minimum require 6 years before the children are ready to be recruited, then additional time will be required for their training before they can enter active service.',
'A generic term for the Ottoman military, it was mainly applied to a class of imperial administrators in the Ottoman Empire. This elite class consisted of four main groups: the military, the court officials, the nobility, and the religious clergy. Though the term itself literally means "of the military", it more broadly encompasses all higher levels of imperial administration. To be a member of this ruling elite, one thus had to hold a political office in the service of the Ottoman Empire, meaning that both Muslims and non-Muslims in those positions could be considered askeri. It was contrasted with the reaya, the tax-paying lower class, and the kul, or slave class, which included the Janissaries. The Sipahi class were of all the elite military caste the most comparable to European knights- they were fundamentally feudal warriors. A tîmâr was the smallest unit of land held by a Sipahi, providing a yearly revenue of no more than 20,000 akçe, which was between two and four times what a teacher earned. A ziamet (زعامت) was a larger unit of land, yielding up to 100,000 akçe, and was owned by Sipahis of officer rank. A has (غاص) was the largest unit of land, giving revenues of more than 100,000 akçe, and was only held by the highest-ranking members of the military. A tîmâr Sipahi was obliged to provide the army with up to five retainers (jebelu), a ziamet Sipahi with up to twenty, and a has Sipahi with far more than twenty. In contrast to Jannisaries, Timarli Sipahis were always exclusively ethnic Turks. It is thought that this was a way to control and to separate two fundamental army divisions (jannisary and sipahi) completely from each other and alienating Turks from capitol city politics while maintaining a controlled Turkish elite of bureaucracy and nobility in Anatolia and Balkans, without the danger of creating rival Turkish dynasties to the Ottoman throne (which was a central reason of destruction for earlier Turkish states). This way, jannisaries who controlled the central bureaucracy of the empire and had a lot of political authority, and sipahis who controlled the provincial bureaucracy and had the power of the army, would always have rivalry and never could cooperate against the House of Osman.',
'The first Ottoman army had been composed entirely of Turkmen nomads, who had remained largely under the command of the religious orders that had converted most of them to Islām. Armed with bows and arrows and spears, these nomadic cavalrymen had lived mostly on booty, although those assigned as ghazis to border areas or sent to conquer and raid Christian lands also had been given more permanent revenues in the form of taxes levied on the lands they garrisoned. These revenue holdings were formalized as mukâṭaʿas, held by tribal leaders and ghazi commanders who in time blurred into the timariot clas that served the Ottoman sultan and in return were granted a fief called a timar. The institution of muqata''ah functioned as an instrument in financing state expenses. The Ottoman bureaucrats of finance, by means of this institution, tried to meet state currency needs, raise loans in the interior and incorporate private entrepreneurship in the financing of the state. The system of muqata''ah was a form of tax farming where a district or individual agreed to pay the state a fixed sum in return for fiscal autonomy and limited state intervention. The regular army was commanded and paid by some important fief-holders who gained power and became a sort of noble class. The mercenaries became a tool for their rise to predominance over the sultan, who simply could not afford to hire so many mercenaries that they would outnumber his nobles''. Therefore, in the middle of the 14th century, Murad I built his own personal slave army called the Kapıkulu. The new force was based on the sultan''s right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include captives taken in battle. The captive slaves were converted to Islam and trained in the sultan''s personal service. The most famous branch of the Kapıkulu was the Janissary corps who were recruited among young Christian boys by the devshirmeh tax, but there were also several other troops types such as the Halberdier corps (Baltacı). Their numbers increased rapidly and this force became the most important element of the Ottoman army. In order to man the force, Murad II developed the devşirme system of recruiting youths in form of taxes from Christians in the empire. Murad used the strength of the Janissaries and played them off against the nobility, forcing them to pay taxes or land so that the treasury could obtain the money it needed to maintain the Kapıkulu army.',
'Janissaries became the first Ottoman standing army, replacing forces that mostly comprised tribal ghazis, whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The janissary corps was organized in ortas (equivalent to a battalion). An orta was headed by a çorbaci. All ortas together would comprise the proper janissary corps and its organization named ocak (literally "hearth"). Janissaries were taught to consider the corps as their home and family, and the Sultan as their father. Only those who proved strong enough earned the rank of true Janissary at the age of twenty-four or twenty-five. The Ocak inherited the property of dead Janissaries, thus amassing wealth (like religious orders and foundations enjoying the "dead hand"). Janissaries trained under strict discipline with hard labour and in practically monastic conditions in acemi oglan ("rookie" or "cadet") schools, where they were expected to remain celibate. They were also expected to convert to Islam. All did, as Christians were not allowed to bear arms in the Ottoman Empire. The role assigned to the voynuks were as trusted agents of the Ottoman authorities in the Balkan provinces, they had to guard the Christian youths, recruited to become Janissaries, on the long way from their homelands to Istanbul. Since the law mentions the voynuks, it is clear that the Ottoman authorities deem them most suitable among those for the job. Both voynuks and the boys taken under the Janissary levy originate from the Christian peoples, subjects of the Sultan, the voynuk corps consisted mainly of Bulgarians. After the initial acquisition of the slaves, the janissaries would require anywhere between 10-20 years of training in order to become active soldiers.',
'Frontier troops; also spelled jemaat with 101 ortas. They were largely considered separate from the Janissary corps although their origins and their duties were often confused. Azap frontiersmen were mainly Anatolian Turks and formed a kind of regular army or levy that was parallel to the ever-increasing importance of the janissaries. However, freed slaves could become Azaps which is often where the cultural and ethnic backgrounds become difficult to distinguish.',
'The beyliks or beuluks (the Sultan''s own bodyguard), with 61 ortas. These were the top level Janissaries, the long construction time of Ocak and Boluk buildings has been to represent the drawn-out period of training of the Janissaries after been taken as slave children- they are now ready to serve.',
'The sekban or seirnen, was the latest development within the corps and considered the ultimate elite with just 34 ortas. The organizational structure and command and control system of the Janissary corps changed dramatically after the addition of the Sekban units, which was the outcome of a deliberate decision to reinforce the loyalty of the corps to the sultan.',

'Atashgah, literally ''place of the fire'' in which the actual fire-altar stands. A temple at which a Yasna service (the principal Zoroastrian act of worship that accompanies the recitation of the Yasna liturgy) may be celebrated will always have, attached to it or on the grounds, at least a well or a stream or other source of ''natural'' water. This is a critical requirement for the Ab-Zohr, the culminating rite of the Yasna service. Only priests attached to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed on at least one side and has a double domed roof.',
'Atashkada, a Classical Persian language term that together with its middle Persian predecessors (atash-kadag, -man and -xanag) literally means ''house of fire''. The oldest remains of what has been identified as a fire-temple are those on Mount Khajeh, near Lake Hamun in Sistan. Only traces of the foundation and ground-plan survive and have been tentatively dated to the 3rd or 4th century BCE. The temple was rebuilt during the Parthian era (250 BCE-226 CE), and enlarged during Sassanid times (226–650 CE). The characteristic feature of the Sassanid fire temple was its domed sanctuary where the fire-altar stood. This sanctuary always had a square ground plan with a pillar in each corner that then supported the dome (the gombad). Archaeological remains and literary evidence from Zend commentaries on the Avesta suggest that the sanctuary was surrounded by a passage way on all four sides. "On a number of sites the gombad, made usually of rubble masonry with courses of stone, is all that survives, and so such ruins are popularly called in Fars čahār-tāq or ''four arches''."',
'The Atash Dadgah is the lowest grade of sacred fire, and can be consecrated within the course of a few hours by two priests, who alternatingly recite the 72 verses of the Yasna liturgy. Consecration may occasionally include the recitatation of the Vendidad, but this is optional. A lay person may tend the fire when no services are in progress. The term is not necessarily a consecrated fire, and the term is also applied to the hearth fire, or to the oil lamp found in many Zoroastrian homes.',
'The next highest grade of fire is the Atash Adaran, the "Fire of fires". It requires a gathering of hearth fire from representatives of the four professional groups (that reflect feudal estates): from a hearth fire of the asronih (the priesthood), the (r)atheshtarih (soldiers and civil servants), the vastaryoshih (farmers and herdsmen) and the hutokshih (artisans and laborers). Eight priests are required to consecrate an Adaran fire and the procedure takes between two and three weeks.',
'The highest grade of fire is the Atash Behram, "Fire of victory", and its establishment and consecration is the most elaborate of the three. It involves the gathering of 16 different "kinds of fire", that is, fires gathered from 16 different sources, including lightning, fire from a cremation pyre, fire from trades where a furnace is operated, and fires from the hearths as is also the case for the Atash Adaran. Each of the 16 fires is then subject to a purification ritual before it joins the others. 32 priests are required for the consecration ceremony, which can take up to a year to complete. A temple that maintains an Adaran or Behram fire also maintains at least one Dadgah fire. In contrast to the Adaran and Behram fires, the Dadgah fire is the one at which priests then celebrate the rituals of the faith, and which the public addresses to invoke blessings for a specific individual, a family or an event. Veneration of the greater fires is addressed only to the fire itself — that is, following the consecration of such a fire, only the Atash Nyashes, the litany to the fire in Younger Avestan, is ever recited before it.',
'A Tower of Silence or Dakhma (Persian: دخمه) is a circular, raised structure used by Zoroastrians for exposure of the dead. Zoroastrian tradition considers a dead body—in addition to cut hair and nail-parings—to be nasu, unclean, i.e. potential pollutants. Specifically, the corpse demon (Avestan: nasu.daeva) was believed to rush into the body and contaminate everything it came into contact with, hence the Vendidad (an ecclesiastical code "given against the demons") has rules for disposing of the dead as "safely" as possible. To preclude the pollution of earth or fire (see Zam and Atar respectively), the bodies of the dead are placed atop a tower—a tower of silence—and so exposed to the sun and to birds of prey. Thus, "putrefaction with all its concomitant evils" "is most effectually prevented." The towers, which are fairly uniform in their construction, have an almost flat roof, with the perimeter being slightly higher than the center. The roof is divided into three concentric rings: The bodies of men are arranged around the outer ring, women in the second circle, and children in the innermost ring. Once the bones have been bleached by the sun and wind, which can take as long as a year, they are collected in an ossuary pit at the center of the tower, where—assisted by lime—they gradually disintegrate and the remaining material—with run-off rainwater—runs through multiple coal and sand filters before being eventually washed out to sea.',
'The Farnbag fire translated as ''the fire Glory-Given'' was considered the most venerated because it was seen as the earthly representative of the Atar Spenishta, ''Holiest Fire'' of Yasna 17.11 and described in a Zend commentary on that verse as "the one burning in Paradise in the presence of Ohrmazd." The remains at Takht-i-Suleiman, midway between Urumieh and Hamadan, as the temple of Adur Gushnasp. The location of the Mithra fire, i.e. that of Burzen-Mihr, identified with reasonable certainty at being near the village of Mihr half-way between Miandasht and Sabzevar on the Khorasan road to Neyshabur. The Indian (lesser) Bundahishn records the Farnbag fire having been "on the glory-having mountain which is in Khwarezm" but later moved "upon the shining mountain in the district of Kavul just as it there even now remains"). That the temple once stood in Khwarezm is also supported by the Greater (Iranian) Bundahishn and by the texts of Zadsparam. However, according to the Greater Bundahishn, it was moved "upon the shining mountain of Kavarvand in the Kar district" (the rest of the passage is identical to the Indian edition). Darmesteter identified this ''Kar'' as Kariyan in Pars (Persia proper), "celebrated for its sacred fire which has been transported there from Khvarazm as reported by Masudi"',

'The ciftlik-re''aya system was the dominant regime in the Ottoman Empire covering an overwhelming majority of the rural population along with most of the arable lands. It was not originally an Ottoman invention, but it was rather the re-establishment of an old system which had replaced servile labor as the major form of agricultural labor, economically the most advantageous and socially the safest under the demographic and economic conditions which prevailed during late antiquity. It can even be said that the Islamic Caliphate and the Eastern Roman Empire owed their enduring imperial existence to the fact that they embraced and became the champions of this regime which favored the continuance of independent peasant family units on the land. This was the basic social and economic structure of the Ottoman Empire, carefully watched by the imperial government. Moreover, the Ottoman administration was ready to change the slave status of certain groups and eventually identified them with the re''aya when overall developments began to lead toward the disappearance of servile labor -- the difflculties in keeping a slave community within a majority of free peasants, the erosion of this community by frequent runaways and marriages with free men, and, perhaps the most important of all, the fact that slave labor became unprofitable under the new conditions of rising prices. But still, whenever private ownership under the Sharia stipulations was in question, especially on large estates and konaks any government disposition was excluded.',
'Under the first Ottoman Sultans servile labor appears to have been employed to form extensive cattle and sheep ranches in Bythinia. Big farms thus formed by the grandees were mostly turned into pious endowments. As an inalienable part of the farms slaves were entered in the endowment documents often by their names. In transactions they are treated in the same way as other properties. In some endowment deeds it is made clear that slaves settled in the farm or village were prisoners of war captured by the founder. Over time some of the farms thus formed developed into villages and the descendants of the slaves in them were always separately registered as sharecropping slaves (ortakdji kul). In some other cases it is reported that slaves ran away and farms or villages were left in ruins. The best example of the state''s use of slave labor in reclaiming an abandoned agricultural area is Mehmed the Conqueror''s attempt at settling with slaves a large area called Khasslar encompassing 163 villages around Istanbul and Pera between 1453 and 1480. Actually it was a part of his larger plan for the reconstruction of Istanbul. By placing under state ownership the arable lands under cultivation in this area he intended to contribute to the provisioning of the city, to create new sources of revenue for the treasury, and to keep the neighborhood of the capital in order and safety, as is pointed out in the regulation made in 1498. Mass deportation of enslaved peasants from enemy territories was used for this purpose. This was not only because the Conqueror planned a rapid recovery of the area but also because settlement of reaya deportees, surgun, from his own territories proved to be difflcult to carry out and ruinous for the areas from which the deportation was made. It was impossible to go too far in this operation because it violated the basic rights of the re''aya, Muslim and non-Muslim, by forcing them to stay in their new settlements. It should be added that shortage of agricultural labor was a general phenomenon in this period.',
'The mulkiye group broke down into two distinct subgroups; the enderun (inner service) and the birun (outer service). This distinction was based on the physical organization of the imperial palace, which was built around two large courts separated by a wall through which one could pass only by the Gate of Felicity (Bab-i sa''adet), the door that led to the personal presence of the sultan. Those who passed through the gate either spent their entire lives within the confines of the inner palace or were transferred out periodically to other services. The highest ranking enderun functionaries usually were appointed to the most important provincial positions when they left the palace. From there they could be brought back to the capital to serve in the central government, which was part of the birun. Those who belonged to the enderun were all kapi kulus (kapi being another word for gate), slaves of the Porte. After the devsirme system was introduced they came almost exclusively from the European provinces. Their education began in the palace where they moved from the school of pages to higher training centers and duties within the inner courtyard. The best reached the highest position available within the enderun service. When transferred, in accordance with their accomplishments in the inner palace, these men became the most important office-holders in the outer service and in the provinces.',
'In Islamic law, a mukataba is a contract of manumission between a master and a slave according to which the slave is required to pay a certain sum of money during a specific time period in exchange for freedom. In the legal literature, slaves who enter this contract are known as mukatab. Although the owner did not have to comply with the request, it was considered mustahabb (praiseworthy) to do so. Mukataba is one of the four procedures provided in Islam for manumission of slaves.The emancipation of a mukatab occurs only when he has paid to the master the agreed amount in full. The contract may be revoked when the slave defaults on one of the payments. The mukatab may receive the proceeds from the Islamic charity (zakat), but he is not entitled to them When the mukatab makes the final payment, he is entitled to a rebate, in compliance with the Qur''anic text. Islamic authorities disagree as to whether the rebate is obligatory or merely recommended and whether its sum is fixed or discretionary. After manumission, the slave liberated through mukataba remains a client (mawali) of his former master. The benefits of this culturally were that the slaves were encouraged to deliver loyalty and financial gains into the social netweokr and economy at large. It also nurtured the development of a social class with workers (freedmen) in the employment in trades, arts and guilds to a master.',
'Known as the hereditary provinces, hukumet sancaks, their only obligation besides fealty, was the delivery of a yearly tribute and this in turn was a recognition of freeholdings and a social standing among freed slaves as well as the professional classes of the Ottomans.',
'Basically an extended household, usually a group of slaves, freemen and servants making up a noble''s estates. These h''ouses'' were a powerful social instituion which gelled together the various classes and ackownledged their interdependency and reliance as well as duty towards one another.',

'Usury from Medieval Latin usuria, "interest", or from Latin usura, "interest" originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as investment and capital. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. The term is largely derived from Christian religious principles; Riba is the corresponding Arabic term and ribbit is the Hebrew word. The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury (canon 17). At the time, usury was interest of any kind, and the canon merely forbade the clergy to lend money on interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% APR). Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity. The Third Lateran Council decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor Christian burial. Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury a heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation which allowed it. Pope Sixtus V condemned the practice of charging interest as "detestable to God and man, damned by the sacred canons and contrary to Christian charity." All of this however, had absolutely no application to Jews. The Torah makes a distinction between interest deducted before the loan is handed over and interest deducted afterwards. What is clear – as with so much of the Old Testament – is that many prohibitions applied within the Jewish community did not apply outside. In other words, there was a loophole allowing interest to be charged to gentiles. Nonetheless Talmudic Law confined Jewish interest rates to 20%. With the rise of Templar banking and Italian banking who both had comparatively astronomical interest rates (possibly due to the social constrictions which they had found loopholes through) Jewish banking remained extremely popular due to its fairness. As the Jews were ostracized from most professions by local rulers, the church and the guilds, they were pushed into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending. Natural tensions between creditors and debtors were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Precisely in the same way that the aristoricies and European royal families found themselves indebted to the Templars and thereby conspired their demise, so Jews were pushed out of Europe. In 1275, Edward I of England passed the Statute of Jewry which made usury illegal and linked it to blasphemy, in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to the Crown. In 1290, all Jews were expelled from England, and allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown''s. The usury was cited as the official reason for the Edict of Expulsion. The violence targetted at Jews increased in Europe, no doubt encouraged by the indebted aristocracy. In time Italian bankers won the financial war and their way of doing business transformed European commerce, dragging Europe into the Renaissance.',

'A Persian-style garden, quadrilaterally divided by walkways or flowing water. In Persian, "Chār" means ''four'' and "bāgh" means ''garden''. The Persian legacy had an enormous impact on the Middle East, Bāgh (Persian: باغ) is a word common to Persian, Kurdish, Lurish, Urdu and Azarbaijani and means garden and orchard, specifically one containing fruit- and flower-bearing trees. In Armenian the word Bagh, pronounced Bakhg, means Garden or field. Chahrbagh originated from the time of Achaemenid Persia. Greek historians, such as Herodotus and Xenophon, give extensive accounts of Cyrus the Great''s palatial city of Pasargadae and his four-gardens. The Achaemenid kings set these gardens within enclosed royal hunting parks, a different landscape garden tradition, which they inherited from the Assyrians, for whom the ritual lion hunt was a rite that authenticated kingship, far more than a mere royal sport. In the Muslim era, many of these paradise gardens formed the epicentre of semi-religious complexes, cultural sites and public monuments. Usually kept within the demesne of a ruler or commonly a Sufi colony, they were extensively used in a passive political role such as receiving foreign dignataries and diplomats.',
'It is not a place of worship in the strict sense of the term; the accent is laid on its aspect as lieu of assemblage (cem; pronounced djem). Historically, the Cems were usually held outdoors, using candles and torches to light up the place of gathering when it got dark. Often, people from nearby places would come to a cem to have a collective meal. The participants would often bring along food, which they would then distribute during the meal. Cemevi in the elevated sense were usually linked to Sufi hostels and complexes, and were sites of special public celebration and significance.',
'An inalienable religious endowment in Islamic law, typically denoting a building or plot of land for Muslim religious or charitable purposes. The donated assets are held by a charitable trust. The grant is known as mushrut-ul-khidmat, while a person making such dedication is known as wakif.',
'Deriving from the Arabic word "kull" (meaning the whole, all) is a term which designates a complex of buildings, centered around a mosque and managed within a single institution, often based on a vakıf (foundation), and composed of a medrese, a darüşşifa, kitchens, bakery, hammam, other buildings for various benevolent services for the community and further annexed constructions. The tradition of külliye is particularly marked in Turkish architecture within Seljuk, particularly Ottoman Empire and also Timurid architectural legacies.',
'Turkic for ''great mosque'', the word ''ulu'' can be found in the Mongolian term for the Golden Horde ''Züchi-iin Ulus''. Several Great Mosques were built in the Ottoman period specifically, such as those as Bursa and Adana. The Bursa mosque is typical of the Turkic fashion of carrying elements from Seljuk architecture. Ordered by Sultan Bayezid I, the mosque was designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1400. It is a large rectangular building, with a total of twenty domes that are arranged in four rows of five, and are supported by twelve columns. Supposedly the twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which Sultan Bayezid I had promised for winning the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. The mosque has two minarets. There is also a fountain (şadırvan) inside the mosque, where worshipers can perform ritual ablutions before prayer; the dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which creates a soft, serene light below; thus playing an important role in the illumination of the large building. The horizontally spacious and dimly lit interior is designed to feel peaceful and contemplative. The subdivisions of space formed by multiple domes and pillars create a sense of privacy and even intimacy. Inside the mosque there are 192 monumental wall inscriptions written by the famous Ottoman calligraphers of that period. The mosque has one of the greatest examples of Islamic calligraphy in the world. The Calligraphy is written on the walls, columns and on small and large plates.',
'Türbe is the Turkish word for "tomb", and for the characteristic mausoleums, often relatively small, of Ottoman royalty and notables. It is related to the Arabic turba, which can also mean a mausoleum, but more often a funerary complex, or a plot in a cemetery.',
'A Turkic term for a Great Inn or Caravanserai. The most famous historical site to be referred to in this way was built in 1572 by the first Ottoman governor of Cyprus, Muzaffer Pasha. Its architecture is based on numerous hans (inns) encountered in Anatolia: a courtyard surrounded with rooms arranged on two floors. The lower rooms were used as shops, storage rooms and offices. The rooms on the upper floor served for lodging and each fitted with a fireplace and typically an ornate octagonal chimney. In the middle of the courtyard there is a domed octagonal miniature mosque resting on eight columns with a fountain for ablutions under it.',
'A rabat meant literally "Fortified Place" and Melik or Malik was a term for a prince or great ruler. It was used to signify a royal complex, usually combining military, governmental and cultural buildings. The most famous site of this sort is a Caravanserai in Uzbekistan, on the road from the great cities of Samarkand to Bukhara constructed according to the orders of Karakhanid Shams-al-Mulk Nasr, son of Tamgachkhan Ibragim, who ruled in Samarkand from 1068 until 1080.',

'Daskara is arabicized from the Pahlavi dastakarta (Dastkarta, Dastakrta), modern Persian Dastad̲j̲ird [q.v.]; it means a post, a village, a town or simply level ground however it was used in the late Persian period to refer to estates given to retainers, these would populate the outposts on the caravan routes and therefore man the postal service and guard stages.

'Arg (or Ark), the inner fortress or citadel of a walled city. The arg may also serve as the residence of a ruler and include other court and government offices. From Safavid through Qajar times, the arg of a provincial capital was generally the military headquarters and administrative center of the city and its dependencies. Though an arg is sometimes referred to as a qaḷʿa, the generic term for fortress, the latter term should more strictly designate an isolated fort or one sited at a strategic point outside the town it defends. The arg always lay inside the city wall, sometimes adjacent to it and functioning as part of the defenses; it is analogous to the Roman arx, from which the Persian word may have derived, as well as the Norman keep (donjon). Its etymology is obscure: the term appears in Middle Persian only in the compound argbed (q.v.) a military rank and, though evidently in use during the 3rd/9th century (see under Arg-e Zaranǰ below), does not occur frequently in New Persian before the early 11th/17th century. It is used also by Persian writers of Central Asia and northern India to designate the fortress of a city (e.g., Bukhara, Delhi). The principal Iranian towns that have been noted for their arg are Bam, Kermān, Shiraz, Tabrīz, Tehran, and Zaranǰ.',

'The boyūtāt included those units of the royal household concerned with supplies and related basic services: larders, storerooms, coalbins, and cellars; essential facilities for food preparation, like cooking, baking, butchering, and roasting coffee; and court apothe­cary and baths. Another category consisted of magazines and storerooms for furnishings and other household objects, like lamps, firewood, candles, utensils, and carpets, as well as the royal treasury itself. Among workshops in the narrow sense those for weaving, fulling, garment making, shoemaking, cabinetmaking, goldsmithing, minting, and bookbinding have been attested. Finally, the stables were also included among the boyūtāt, In the Il-khanid period (7-8th/13th-14th centuries) merchants and artisans in the urban centers were not in a position to supply the daily and luxury needs of the court. To fill these needs two institutions were introduced under the aegis of the crown. On one hand, the ordū-bāzār (army bāzār) was especially geared to the needs of a mobile court, for it could be set up wherever the court and the army happened to be encamped. Subsequently the Jalayerids, Āq Qoyunlū, Qara Qoyunlū, and Timurids continued this practice. Only under the Safavids did the ordū-bāzār lose its significance. On the other hand, the prince maintained manufactories es­pecially to produce weapons and military equipment for the court. Also to be men­tioned are the numerous craftsmen and artists whom the Mongols and particularly Tīmūr and his followers forcibly transported as war booty to work under royal auspices, for example, in architecture, architectural decoration, and the arts of the book.',

'Dar al-Harb (Arabic: دار الحرب "house of war"; also referred to as Dar al-Garb "house of the West" in later Ottoman sources; a person from "Dar al-Harb" is a "harbi" (Arabic:حربي)) is a term classically referring to those countries which Muslims have war with, in the matter of worship and the protection of the faithful and Dhimmis. Territories that do have a treaty of nonaggression or peace with Muslims are called dar al-ahd or dar al-sulh. These realms are contrasted with Dar al-Islam. In the 14th century text "Reliance of the Traveller" by al-Misri, there a hadith referred to containing the exact word Dar al-Harb. A crucial distinction made in Islamic theology is that between dar al-harb and dar al-islam. To put it simply, dar al-harb (territory of war or chaos) is the name for the regions where Islam does not dominate, where divine will is not observed, and therefore where continuing strife is the norm. By contrast, dar al-islam (territory of peace) is the name for those territories where Islam does dominate, where submission to God is observed, and where peace and tranquility reign. The distinction is not quite as simple as it may at first appear. For one thing, the division is regarded as legal rather than theological. Dar al-harb is not separated from dar al-islam by things like the popularity of Islam or divine grace; rather, it is separated by the nature of the governments which have control over a territory. A Muslim-majority nation not ruled by Islamic law is still dar al-harb, while a Muslim-minority nation ruled by Islamic law could qualify as being part of dar al-islam.',
'The ‘realm of Islam,’ a term used in classical Islamic jurisprudence to denote regions or countries subject to Islamic law. Dar al-Islam (Arabic: دار الإسلام‎ literally house/abode of Islam; or Dar as-Salam, house/abode of Peace; or Dar al-Tawhid, house/abode of Union) is a term used by Muslim scholars to refer to those countries where Muslims can practice their religion freely. These are usually Islamic cultures wherein Muslims represent the majority of the population, and so the government promises them protection. Most Dar al-Islam areas are surrounded by other Islamic societies to ensure public protection./nMuslim scholars maintain and believe that the labelling of a country or place as being a part of Dar al-Islam revolves around the question of religious security. This means that if a Muslim practices Islam freely in his place of abode despite that the place happens to be secular or un-Islamic, then he will be considered as living in the Dar al-Islam. Dar al-Islam is also known and referred to as Dar al-Salam, or house/abode of Peace. The term appears in the Koran in 10.25 and 6.127 as a name of Paradise.According to Abu Hanifa, considered to be the originator of the concept, the two requirements for a country to be part of Dar al-Islam are: Muslims must be able to enjoy peace and security with and within this country. It has common frontiers with some Muslim countries./nIf the former does not apply then physical means such as Jihad can be used to correct the situation and in the latter case, individuals are required to do hijra to where they can practice their religion.',
'The term caliphate, "dominion of a caliph (''successor'')" (from the Arabic خلافة or khilāfa, Turkish: Hilafet), refers to the first system of government established in Islam and represented the leader''s unity of the Muslim Ummah (community). In theory, it is an aristocratic–constitutional republic (the Constitution being the Constitution of Medina), which means that the head of state, the Caliph, and other officials are representatives of the people and of Islam and must govern according to constitutional and religious law, or Sharia. In its early days, it resembled elements of direct democracy (see shura) and an elective monarchy. It was initially led by Muhammad''s disciples as a continuation of the leaders and religious system the prophet established, known as the ''Rashidun caliphates''. A "caliphate" is also a state which implements such a governmental system. Sunni Islam stipulates that the head of state, the caliph, should be selected by Shura – elected by Muslims or their representatives. Followers of Shia Islam believe the caliph should be an imam chosen by God from the Ahl al-Bayt (Muhammad''s purified progeny). After the first four caliphs, the Caliphate was claimed by dynasties such as the Umayyads, the Abbasids, and the Ottomans, and for relatively short periods by other, competing dynasties in al-Andalus, North Africa, and Egypt.',
'Lit. ‘period of concealment’. Qadi Nu‘man (d. 974) uses the term dawr al-satr to refer to the period of around 150 years in which the Isma‘ili imams were hidden from public knowledge, and which ended with the appearance of ‘Abdallah (or ‘Ubaydallah) ‘al-Mahdi’, who in Nu‘man’s terminology started the period of disclosure (dawr al-kashf). According to Abu Ya‘qub al-Sijistani (d. after 971), dawr al-satr refers to the period when truth is concealed from the senses, that is, the period that started with Adam and which he expected to end upon the return of Muhammad b. Ismail as the Mahdi. Later, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1274) speaks of periods of concealment that can take place when the imam’s true spiritual reality is not manifested, even if he is physically available.',
'Lit. ‘abode of emigration’. Often used as a term for the mountain fortresses of the Assassins. This can also be associated with Dawat al-haqq Lit. ‘summons’, ‘mission’ or invitation to Islam. Amongst Shi‘i Muslims, it was the invitation to adopt the cause of the Imamat. ‘The true mission’ or ‘the true summons’ was a term used by the Ismailis of the pre–Fatimid and Fatimid periods to refer to their da‘wa activities.',
'A fidawi is a young devotee who volunteers to sacrifice his life for a cause. Between the 11th and the 13th centuries, fida’is are known to have gradually formed a corps whose members were sent from Alamut and the other Nizari fortresses in Iran and Syria to assassinate certain prominent enemies of the Nizaris, usually in public locations. Legends were developed by Muslim and Crusader authors, who began to attribute every single political assassination to the Nizaris. The myth that fida’is were called hashashin because they consumed hashish was popularised by European authors such as Marco Polo (d. 1324).',

'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',
'The sheer size of these magnificent defences is enough to awe the peasants who work in their shadow! These walls are extremely costly, but that price guarantees security against all but the most well-prepared besieging force. Thanks to strong towers, battlements and gatehouses, the defenders can make any assault a chancy business.',

'A Shipwright has the slipway, wood seasoning stores and manpower needed to build ships for a strong fleet. The improved port buildings - and simple improvements like creating permanent wharves along a waterfront - allow more trade to occur.',
'A Dockyard allows the construction of larger ships, and the improved wharves make trade easier to manage. Goods from all over the world pass through the docks, bringing wealth and excitement into the lives of citizens.',
'A Naval Dockyard allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the port to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',

'Land Clearance is the first step on the road to establishing organised farming in the countryside, and ensuring that a region will begin to grow and prosper. Though there is little more to land clearance than deforestation and basic tilling of the soil, any area where the local establishment has not taken such measures to make the land workable will struggle to feed its populace.',
'Communal Farming is the natural progression from land clearance, where the farming communities adopt a system of centralised management. By sharing common resources and transportation, communal farming sees all the individual farms in the community achieve a level of productivity, prosperity and security that would otherwise be unattainable.',
'Crop Rotation is a more advanced farming system that maximises the use of farming districts all year round. Going to the trouble of planting different crops in different seasons not only ensures that something is always growing, varying the produce actually improves the soil quality markedly so as to reap greater harvests all year round.',
'Irrigation represents the final frontier in terms of actively improving farming districts. Water is diverted to crops via a system of man-made channels dug into the earth so as to dramatically improve soil fertility. Although irrigating the land is grand and arduous task, and maintaining proper irrigation is an ongoing job, the benefits from the resulting surplus of food produced make the endeavour well worth it.',

'National armies were gathered for campaigns in a specific office usually attached to weapon stores. Men from all over the province would assemble and usually have their names taken down and documented in a roll either individually or under a unit officer/sergeant. Often a man would be banded into local groups, arriving with his family or neighbours and they would be documented for pay as a group in this respect. Once the names were taken, terms of service and pay established and the men organised into fighting bodies or companies the army would then mobilise from this centre.',
'Standing armies of the professional (above militia level) were quite rare or fairly small and localised. Nobles and guard retinues to lords or kings were a development based on central authority, continued warfare, the need for internal state security and the organisation to exact taxation. Extended retinues could form a core ''army'' around a duke, bishop or king and would generally be continually deployed to earn their keep, usually in one of the roles mentioned above. At ''home'' they would live, eat, sleep and train together where their loyalty could be properly overseen and their ability to be quickly mobilised enhanced.',
'As campaigns became more regular, the need for proper organisation of units from the noble to levy levels was seen as a sensible way of maintaining order in battle and cohesion for tactics and strategical surety. Fields and flat areas such as marshlands were often used for military drills. FitzStephen in the time of King Henry III describes the militias and standing army training together iin the area of Aldgate, making reference to the military exercises conducted annually, as well as other sports with a military bent, such as tournament-type activities on the Thames or the frozen marshes, javelin throwing, and hand-to-hand combat. In his opening paragraph, he praises in the same breath the commercial success of the townsmen and their physical prowess, while at the same time boasting of the strength of its fortifications. His estimate of London forces comprised 60,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry.',
'Usually seen as a post-medieval concept, regiments (related to the word ''regime''- rule or organisation) was merely the term applied to constitutions of companies or societas armorum assembled into a larger body. Typically formed around the provincial capital, or capital of the realm these armies would be relatively small in number during peactime but comprised the royal administrative officers and the masters-at-arms, standard-bearers, squires and a large host of logistical staff who could not be disbanded due to the needs of military efficiency. These were usually all under control of the monarch and/or the Marshall of the Realm. When nobles and levies were called up into service it would be this core ''headquarters'' that would be responsible for overseeing pay, terms of service, organisation and the enforcement of marshall law.',
'With the event of more serious attempts to create professional armies, particularly thanks to drawn-out campaigns such as the 100 Years War or the constant local fighting in Italy or Spain, the need to apply tactics and strategy beyond the previously accepted social boundaries of piety was required. Hardly comparable to schools or colleges, these ''academia'' were generally speaking no more than an idea imposed over the earlier military structure. The royal and national retinues would propogate specific organisational ideas and the doctrines of the ''science of war''. With the rise of the crossbow, longbow, gunpowder and sieging methods which neutralised the ''panzers'' of piety in the form of the knights, cost effective forces could be now maintained and kept on constant stand-by or actual deployment in campaigns.',
'In the 1300s warfare on the large scale had developed scientifically in great bounds. In the small scale it was also nurtured in Europe into martial arts, where the focus on nobles and their horsemanship was thrown out of the window. Although to be fair, some ''masters'' attempted to transfer and apply many of the old concepts to the continuing tradition the fact was that any man with a sword (pretty much the majority of the male population) could be taught to fight using martial arts. Masters such as the German Johannes Lecküchner, Hans von Speyer, Peter Falkner, Paulus Kal and Hans Folz all developed advanced (and most importantly documented) schools of fighting using various weapons such as polearms, heavy swords, and light swords with bucklers, even the use of the dagger- traditionally used by lower ranks for killing unhorsed knights using the long blade to delve between the armour. Italian schools were also prominent: in the words of the Pisan Fillipo Vadi "It is good to measure blows and steps, To find your trust in science, Fencing is born from geometry."',
'The word ''limes'' was utilized by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier. The "Roman Limes" represented the border line of the Roman Empire at its greatest extent in the 2nd century AD. It stretched over 5,000 km from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The remains of the Limes today consist of vestiges of built walls, ditches, forts, fortresses, and civilian settlements. The word ''limes'' gave rise to the English ''limits'' and other European equivalents, ''city limits'' were a similar concept to the colonial ''limes'' of an empire, either Roman of medieval. The Limes Saxoniae (Latin for "Limit of Saxony"), also known as the Limes Saxonicus or Sachsenwall ("Saxon Wall"), was a limes or border between the Saxons and the Slavic Obotrites, established about 810 in present-day Schleswig-Holstein. After Charlemagne had finally conquered the Saxon lands, he signed the 811 Treaty of Heiligen with the neighbouring Danes and may at the same time have reached a border agreement with the Polabian Slavs in the east. As no major fortifications existed, the Limes mainly followed natural obstacles like bogs and thick wood. According to Adam of Bremen''s description in the Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum about 1075 AD states that it ran from the Elbe river near Boizenburg northwards along the Bille river to the mouth of the Schwentine at the Kiel Fjord and the Baltic Sea. It was breached several times by the Slavic Obotrites (983 and 1086) and Mieszko II Lambert of Poland (1028 and 1030). The Limes became irrelevant during the first phase of the Ostsiedlung, when Count Henry of Badewide campaigned against the Wagrian lands in 1138/39 and the Slavic population was Germanized by German, mostly Saxon, new settlers. Limes represents the first aspect of colonisation- the establishment of an imperial boundary.',
'Civitas Finitima was a fontier settlement. These regional capitals were considered fairly dangerous places since enemies, either military, political, cultural or economic were beyond the very close boundary of the ''empire'' or faction. Nonethless it was exactly for this reason that populations quickly swelled into these areas where trade and commerce was seen as a worthwhile endeavour and poorer people or those wishing to escape oppression and indentured service in the homelands could establish new lands and farmsteads in the colonies- typically using the old population as serfs or slaves.',
'To accept a province as a vassal, was to recognise its status as part of the realm and usually given to a specific governor. Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus "servant", a term used as part of feudalism in medieval Europe, where one enters into mutual obligations to a monarch, usually in the form of military support and mutual protection, in exchange for certain privileges, usually to include land held as a fiefdom. This system can be applied to similar systems in other feudal societies. Although related, a fidelity, or fidelitas, is somewhat different as it is a sworn loyalty, subject to the king. The stratification of a fighting band of vassals into an upper group composed of great territorial magnates, strong enough to ensure the inheritance of their benefice to the heirs of their family, and a lower group of landless knights attached to a "count" or "duke" might roughly be correlated with the new term "fief" that was superseding "benefice" in the 9th century. The social settling out process also received impetus in fundamental changes in conducting warfare. As the example of the Huns demonstrated to the Romanised world that cavalry superseded a melee of fighting men on foot in determining the outcome of battles, the cost of maintenance of a mounted and increasingly armoured fighting force was inflated. A mounted vassal needed wealth to equip the band of mounted fighters he was under obligation to contribute to his lord''s frequent disputes, and wealth, where a money economy had disappeared, was only to be found in land and its productions, which included peasants, as much a resource of the land as wood and water.',
'A commendation ceremony (commendatio) is a formal ceremony that evolved during the Early Medieval period to create a bond between a lord and his fighting man, called his vassal (Latin vassus). The first recorded ceremony of commendatio was in 7th century France, but the relationship of vassalage was older, and predated even the medieval formulations of a noble class. The lord''s "servant" (vassus) might be born unfree, but the commendatio freed him. When two men entered into a feudal relationship, they underwent a ceremony known as commendation ceremony. The purpose of the commendation was to make a chosen person a vassal of a lord. The commendation ceremony is composed of two elements, one to perform the act of homage and the other an oath of fealty. The physical position for Western Christian prayer that is thought of as typical today—kneeling, with hands clasped—originates from the commendation ceremony. Before this time, European Christians prayed in the orans, which is the Latin, or "praying" position that people of many religions had used in antiquity: standing, with hands outstretched, a gesture still used today in many Christian rituals and deriving from a pagan salute to the sun forming a bodily cross. The kneeling and clasped hands position was to signify an almost bound position as if the hands and feet were tied, this showed that the servant was mentally and physically subject to the lord.',
'The fief (alternatively, fee, feoff, fiefdom) or feudum (in Latin), under the system of medieval European feudalism, often consisted of inheritable lands or revenue-producing property granted by a lord to a vassal who held seisin in return for a form of allegiance (usually given by homage and fealty). Not only land but anything of value could be held in fief, such as an office, a right of exploitation (e.g., hunting, fishing) or any other type of revenue, rather than the land it comes from. In the 10th and 11th centuries the term "fief" (feudum) could be used either to describe dependent tenure held by a man from his lord, as the term is used now by historians, or it could mean simply "property". It lacked a precise meaning until the middle of the 12th century, when it received formal definition from land lawyers. Historically the fiefs of the 11th and the 12th century derived from two separate sources. The first was land carved out of the estates of the upper nobility. The second source was allodial land transformed into dependent tenures. During the 10th century in northern France and the 11th century in France south of the Loire, local magnates either recruited or forced the owners of allodial holdings into dependent relationships and they were turned into fiefs. The process occurred later in Germany, and was still going on in the 13th century. In 13th-century England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy the term "feodum" was used to describe a dependent tenure held from a lord by a vassal in return for a specified amount of knight service and occasional financial payments (feudal incidents).',

'Conscription represents the call to arms in a region, where the ruler raises a national army for rapid deployment. Conscription buildings allow European factions to quickly gain access to a wide range of units without the need for a developed military infrastucture such as stables, barracks or bowyers. Instead, each tier of the conscription allows a mix of unit types dependent on social class. The higher the conscription level the more elite and noble the units available. Be careful however, conscription was extremely unpopular with the people, and should only be used in emergencies for defence or summoning large armies for a campaign. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands! This level requires Provincial Charters, and allows access to levies from the countryside.',

'The curia was the King''s court, composed of those advisers and courtiers who followed the King as he travelled around the country. This was not a dedicated court of law, instead a descendant of the Old English ''witenagemot''. In concert with the curia regis, eyre circuits staffed by itinerant judges dispensed justice throughout the country, operating on fixed paths at certain times. These judges were also members of the curia, and would hear cases on the King''s behalf in the "lesser curia regis". Because the curia travelled with the King, it caused problems with the dispensation of justice; if the King went out of the country, or as Richard I did spent much of his career there, the curia followed. To remedy this a central "bench" was established, with the Court of Common Pleas, initially split from the Exchequer of Pleas, receiving official recognition in Magna Carta so that common pleas could be heard in "some fixed place". There were thus two common law courts; the curia, which followed the King, and the Common Pleas, which sat in Westminster Hall. The curia eventually became known as the King''s Bench, with the King himself required for the court to sit.',
'The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a court that followed equity, a set of legal principles based on natural law, and common law, in England and Wales. Originally part of the curia regis, or King''s Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the curia during the 1190s, sitting as an independent, central court. The court was initially small, handling around 250 cases a year compared to 2,500 in the later Court of King''s Bench and 10,000 in the Court of Common Pleas. The first concrete records come from the time of Henry I, when the sole surviving Pipe Roll from his reign shows the Exchequer working out of the King''s palace as part of the curia regis. The curia regis followed the king as he went rather than sitting at any one fixed location, and was held in York, London and Northampton at various times. By the late 12th century it had taken to sitting in a fixed location (the one body of government in England to do so), and by the 1170s it was possible to distinguish the Exchequer''s work from that of the other parts of the curia regis, although the King of the time considered the Exchequer to simply be an element of the curia; indeed, it was referred to as the Curia Regis ad Scaccarium, or King''s Court at Exchequer. The word "Exchequer" derives from the chequered cloth laid on a table for the purposes of counting money. In the 1190s the Exchequer split from the curia regis, a process which continued until the beginning of the 13th century; due to an increasing demand on the revenue side of the court, which led to part of the common law element being split off to form the Court of Common Pleas.',
'One of the two main administrative offices, along with the Exchequer. It began as part of the royal household -curia regis, but by the 13th-century was separate from the household and was located at Westminster. It produced all the charters and writs, which were all sealed with the Great Seal. The office was headed by the Chancellor of England, and was staffed by royal clerks. It came into existence shortly before the Norman Conquest of England, and was retained by King William I of England after the Conquest. In 1199, the chancery began to keep the Charter Roll, a record of all the charters issued by the office. Then in 1201, the Patent Roll, a similar record of letters patent began, and in 1204 the Close Roll, or record of letters close began. Although the English Chancery was responsible for most of the charters and writs issued by the government, they were not responsible for all of them, as the Exchequer and the justiciars continued to issue writs during the Angevin period. The Chancery started as the personal staff of the Lord Chancellor. The earliest reference to legal issues being sent to him is from 1280, when Edward I of England, annoyed with the number of cases coming to him which could have been dealt with by other elements of his administration, passed a statute saying that: "all petitions that touch the Seal shall go first to the Chancellor, and those that touch the Exchequer to the Exchequer, and those that touch the justices or the law of the land to the justices, and those that touch the Jurie to the justices of the Jurie. And if the matters are so great, or so much of grace, that the Chancellor and the others cannot do what is asked without the King, then they shall take them to the King to know his will, and that no petition come before the King and his Council except by the hands of the said Chancellor and the other chief ministers; so that the King and his Council may be able, without the embarrassment of other business, to attend to the important business of his kingdom and his foreign lands."',
'Under the feudal system that evolved in England following the Norman invasion of 1066, the laws of the Crown could not have been upheld without the support of the nobility and the clergy. The former had economic and military power bases of their own through major ownership of land and the feudal obligations of their tenants (some of whom held lands on condition of military service). The Church - then still part of the Roman Catholic Church and so owing ultimate loyalty to Rome - was virtually a law unto itself in this period as it had its own system of religious law courts. In order to seek consultation and consent from the nobility and the senior clergy on major decisions, post-1066 English monarchs called Great Councils. A typical Great Council would consist of archbishops, bishops, abbots, barons and earls, the pillars of the feudal system. When this system of consultation and consent broke down it often became impossible for government to function effectively. The two most notorious examples of this prior to the reign of Henry III are the cases of Thomas Becket and King John. Becket, who was Archbishop of Canterbury between 1162 and 1170, was murdered following a long running dispute with Henry II over the jurisdiction of the Church. And John, who was king from 1199 to 1216, aroused such hostility from many leading nobles that they forced him to agree to Magna Carta in 1215. John''s refusal to adhere to this treaty led to civil war (First Barons'' War). The Great Council evolved into the Parliament of England. The term itself came into use during the early 13th century, deriving from the Latin and French words for discussion and speaking. The word first appears in official documents in the 1230s. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Kings began to call Knights of the Shire to meet when the monarch saw it as necessary. A notable example of this was in 1254 when sheriffs of counties were instructed to send Knights of the Shire to parliament to advise the king on finance. During the reign of Herny II French-born noble Simon de Montfort emerged as the leader of a rebel faction of nobles that used and in fact convened Parliament without the presence of order of the King. During the reign of Edward I, which began in 1272, the role of Parliament in the government of the English kingdom increased due to Edward''s determination to unite England, Wales and Scotland under his rule by force. He was also keen to unite his subjects in order to restore his authority and not face rebellion as was his father''s fate. Edward therefore encouraged all sectors of society to submit petitions to parliament detailing their grievances in order for them to be sorted out. This seemingly gave all of Edward''s subjects a potential role in government and this helped Edward assert his authority, so over time the power invested by Parliament pendulated widely between nobility and King. In 1341 the Commons met separately from the nobility and clergy for the first time, creating what was effectively an Upper Chamber and a Lower Chamber, with the knights and burgesses sitting in the latter.',
'The Palace of Westminster site was strategically important during the Middle Ages, as it was located on the banks of the River Thames. Known in medieval times as Thorney Island, the site may have been first-used for a royal residence by Canute the Great during his reign from 1016 to 1035. St Edward the Confessor, the penultimate Saxon monarch of England, built a royal palace on Thorney Island just west of the City of London at about the same time as he built Westminster Abbey (1045–50). Thorney Island and the surrounding area soon became known as Westminster (a contraction of the words West Minster). Neither the buildings used by the Saxons nor those used by William I survive. The oldest existing part of the Palace (Westminster Hall) dates from the reign of William I''s successor, King William II. The Palace of Westminster was the monarch''s principal residence in the late Medieval period. The predecessor of Parliament, the Curia Regis (Royal Council), met in Westminster Hall (although it followed the King when he moved to other palaces). The Model Parliament, the first official Parliament of England, met in the Palace in 1295; almost all subsequent Parliaments have met there.Westminster Hall, the oldest existing part of the Palace of Westminster, was erected in 1097, at which point it was the largest hall in Europe. The roof was probably originally supported by pillars, giving three aisles, but during the reign of King Richard II, this was replaced by a hammerbeam roof by the royal carpenter Hugh Herland, "the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture", which allowed the original three aisles to be replaced with a single huge open space, with a dais at the end. The new roof was commissioned in 1393. Richard''s architect Henry Yevele left the original dimensions, refacing the walls, with fifteen life-size statues of kings placed in niches. The rebuilding had been begun by King Henry III in 1245, but had by Richard''s time been dormant for over a century. Westminster Hall has the largest clearspan medieval roof in England, measuring 68 by 240 ft. Oak timbers for the roof came from royal woods in Hampshire and from parks in Hertfordshire and Surrey, among other sources; they were assembled near Farnham, Surrey, 35 miles away. Accounts record the large number of wagons and barges which delivered the jointed timbers to Westminster for assembly.Westminster Hall has served numerous functions. It was primarily used for judicial purposes, housing three of the most important courts in the land: the Court of King''s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Chancery.',
'The court took its name from the "Star Chamber" or "Starred Chamber" which was built in the reign of King Edward II specifically for the meetings of the King''s Council, though the origins of the name of the room itself are unclear. The first reference to the chamber is in 1398, as the Sterred chambre; the more common form of the name appears in 1422 as le Sterne-chamere. Both forms recur throughout the fifteenth century, with Sterred Chambre last attested as appearing in the Supremacy of the Crown Act 1534. Initially well regarded because of its speed and flexibility, it was made up of Privy Counsellors, as well as common-law judges, and supplemented the activities of the common-law and equity courts in both civil and criminal matters. In a sense, the court was a supervisory body, overseeing the operations of lower courts, though its members could hear cases by direct appeal as well. The court was set up to ensure the fair enforcement of laws against prominent people, those so powerful that ordinary courts could never convict them of their crimes. Another function of the Court of Star Chamber was to act like a court of equity, which could impose punishment for actions which were deemed to be morally reprehensible, but not in violation of the letter of the law. This gave the Star Chamber great flexibility as it could punish offenders for any action which the court felt should be illegal even when in fact it was technically legal; however it also meant that the justice imposed by the Star Chamber could be very arbitrary and subjective, and allowed the court to be used later on in its history as an instrument of oppression rather than for the purpose of justice for which it was intended. Many crimes which are now commonly prosecuted such as attempt, conspiracy, libel and perjury were originally developed by the Court of Star Chamber, along with its more common role of dealing with riots and sedition. Star Chamber sessions were closed to the public. King Henry VII used the power of Star Chamber to break the power of the landed gentry which had been such a cause of problems in the Wars of the Roses. When local courts were often clogged or mismanaged, the Court of Star Chamber became a site of remittance for common people against the excesses of the nobility.',
'Court of the King Before the King Himself, also called Coram rege de banco with which it overlapped with the later Court of Common Pleas was an English court of common law in the English legal system. Created from the curia regis, it initially following the monarch on his travels, the King''s Bench finally joined the Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas in Westminster Hall in 1318, making its last travels in 1421. As one of the two principal common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King''s Bench''s jurisdiction and caseload was significant. In 1178, a chronicler recorded that when Henry II: "learned that the land and the men of the land were burdened by so great a number of justices, for there were, eighteen, chose with the counsel of the wise men of his kingdom five only, two clerks three and laymen, all of his private family, and decreed that these five should hear all complaints of the kingdom and should do right and should not depart from the king''s court but should remain there to hear the complaints of men, with this understanding that, if there should come up among them any question which could not be brought to a conclusion by them, it should be presented to a royal hearing and be determined by the king and the wiser men of the kingdom".',
'The Court of Common Pleas did not come into existence until the signing of the Magna Carta, which mandated in Section 17 that common pleas (cases between subject and subject, as opposed to cases involving the king) be heard in "some fixed place". Rather than the Common Pleas being created out of the curia regis directly, it instead arose out of the Exchequer of Pleas, another body split from the curia regis. Chronicles from 1201 identify the "bench" and "exchequer" as distinct bodies, and records of Barons of the Exchequer and Justices of the Common Pleas show a distinct lack of overlap. The Court of Common Pleas, along with the other superior courts, sat in Westminster Hall from its creation.',
'It was originally claimed that the Exchequer was based on a similar Norman court; however, while there are many records of the Exchequer''s work in England, there is no evidence of a similar body in pre-Conquest Normandy. The first concrete records come from the time of Henry I, when the sole surviving Pipe Roll from his reign shows the Exchequer working out of the King''s palace as part of the curia regis. The curia regis followed the king as he went rather than sitting at any one fixed location, and was held in York, London and Northampton at various times. By the late 12th century it had taken to sitting in a fixed location (the one body of government in England to do so), and by the 1170s it was possible to distinguish the Exchequer''s work from that of the other parts of the curia regis, although the King of the time considered the Exchequer to simply be an element of the curia; indeed, it was referred to as the Curia Regis ad Scaccarium, or King''s Court at Exchequer. The word "Exchequer" derives from the chequered cloth laid on a table for the purposes of counting money. In the 1190s the Exchequer split from the curia regis, a process which continued until the beginning of the 13th century; academics have suggested that this is due to an increasing demand on the revenue side of the court, which led to part of the common law element being split off to form the Court of Common Pleas. Although the Exchequer of Pleas was the oldest common law court, it was also the last to separate from the curia regis.',
'Trinoda necessitas is a Latin term used to refer to a "threefold tax" in pre-Conquest times. Subjects of an Anglo-Saxon king were required to yield three services: bridge-bote (repairing bridges and roads), burgh-bote (building and maintaining fortifications), and fyrd-bote (serving in the militia, known as the fyrd). Rulers very rarely exempted subjects from the trinoda necessitas, because these services were the lifeblood of the English kingdom. The term "trinoda necessitas" was rarely used in Anglo-Saxon times: its only known use is in a grant of land near Pagham, Sussex from King Cædwalla of Wessex to Saint Wilfred. After the fall of Anglo-Saxon England to the Normans it was sometimes difficult to enact new laws with a French origin (and name) without first calling on the legitimacy of older English by-laws. Naturally the king and his lords were more than capable of enforcing any Act of Parliament they wanted but it was much easier to convince the English to obey if they admitted it was ''right'' and based on their traditional pre-Conquest duties to the Crown.',
'Often used to signify the Terrae Normannorum (Norman Lands) or those territories which came under Norman Law (in England, Wales, Ireland and France) following the successive expansion of the Duchy of Normandy following the Conquest. Specifically, in feudal law, Nulle terre sans seigneur is the principle that one provides services to the sovereign (usually serving in his army) for the right to receive land from the sovereign. In the original French the expression means "No land without a lord" though the legal sense might be more "no property without a liege" since it was at the basis of the link between the infeodated or ''feal'' (he who gave fealty) and his liege. This was foundational to feudal society, and of course had existed in England and elsewhere long before the Normans, yet it was the ruthless and totalitarian enforcement of this law under the Norman and Post-Norman dynasties that enabled England as a nation to become one of the superpowers of the Middle Ages.',
'Primer Seisin (primary lordship) is a French term used originally by the Normans having inherited the system from France, it ascerted the legal possession of a feudal fiefdom by the king in default on legal matters. In feudal England, "escheat" (from Latin excadere) referred to the situation where the tenant of a fief died without an heir, or had committed a felony. The fief reverted to the King''s ownership for one year and one day, by right of primer seisin, after which it reverted to the original lord who had granted it. From the time of Henry III, the monarchy took particular interest in escheat as a source of revenue. From the 12th century onward, the Crown appointed escheators to manage escheats and report to the Exchequer, with one escheator per county established by the middle of the 14th century. Upon learning the death of a tenant, the escheator would hold an "inquisition post mortem" to learn if the king had any rights to the land. These were often preceded by a "writ of diem clausit extremum" issued by the king to seize the lands and hold the inquisition post mortem. If there was any doubt, the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to Westminster where it would be settled, ensuring that not one day''s revenue would be lost. This would be a source of concern with land owners when there were delays from Westminster.',
'Distraint or distress (from the Latin districtio) was the seizure of someone’s property in order to obtain payment of rent or other money owed. An act or process whereby a person (the distrainor), traditionally even without prior court approval, seizes the personal property of another located upon the distrainor''s land in satisfaction of a claim, as a pledge for performance of a duty, or in reparation of an injury. Distraint typically involved the seizure of goods (chattels) belonging to the tenant by the landlord to sell the goods for the payment of the rent. The Statute of Marlborough was a set of laws passed by King Henry III of England in 1267, still in use today as the "Distress Act of 1267", it saught to govern the recovery of damages ("distresses") and make it illegal to obtain recompense for damages other than through the courts, and c.23 (the Waste Act 1267), which saught to prevent tenant farmers from "making waste" to land they were in tenancy of. Chapter 15 sets out places in which "distresses" are forbidden to be taken; these include the King''s Highway and the Common Street.',
'Also known as "Officium Coronatis". The Statute of Gloucester is one of the most important pieces of legislation enacted in the Parliament of England during the reign of Edward I. The Statute, proclaimed at Gloucester in August 1278, was crucial to the development of English law. The Statute of Gloucester, and the ensuing legal hearings, were a means by which Edward I tried to recover regal authority that had been alienated during the reign of his father, King Henry III (1216-1272) who had been made a virtual tool of the baronial party led by Simon de Montfort. Edward I recognized the need for the legal “reform,” and considered the Parliament as a means of buying popular support by encouraging loyal subjects to petition the King against his own barons and ministers. The Statute of 1278 provided for several important legal amendments, including a modification of novel disseisin (one of the most popular forms of action for the recovery of land which had been seized illegally). It challenged baronial rights through a revival of the system of general eyres (royal justices to go on tour throughout the land), and through a significant increase in the number of pleas of quo warranto (literally “By what warrant?”) to be heard by such eyres. In such proceedings individual barons and franchise holders were expected either to show the King’s judges proper legal title by which they possessed their rights to private jurisdictions, or to lose such rights. The Eyre of September 1194 was held in the County of Kent, and Article 20 baldly stated that: "IN EVERY COUNTY OF THE KING''S REALM SHALL BE ELECTED THREE KNIGHTS AND ONE CLERK, TO KEEP THE PLEAS OF THE CROWN" which is the origin of the word Coroner, from ''Crowner''. Each county had three Coroners and a poor man who had to walk behind their horses, carrying the "Coroners'' Rolls" and pen and ink. Coroners originally had to be Knights and men of substance. This was in accord with Chancellor Walter''s new philosophy: the participation of the middle-class Knights in the administration of the country. Their appointment depended on a certain property level and they had to possess an income of at least £20 a year, which was a large sum in those days. One was actually dismissed from office because he did not come up to this wealth threshold. Coroners were unpaid and it was a serious offence for any of them to receive a reward for their duties - which again was enforced on a number of occasions. Hubert Walter''s had sound reasons for appointing only well-to-do gentlemen to the office. He wished to reduce any temptation for them to follow the Sheriffs'' habit of embezzlement: the assumption being that they were in no need of further wealth.',
'Since the Church never died, the land never left the "dead hand" ("Mortmain" or Church). An alternative explanation of "mortmain" was that an owner from generations earlier was still dictating land use years after death, by leaving it to the Church. Hence the term "dead hand." Before the Statute of Mortmain, large amounts of land were bequethed to the Church, which never relinquished it. This was in contradistinction to normal lands which could be inherited in a family line or revert to a lord or the Crown upon death of the tenant. Church land had been a source of contention between the Crown and the Church for centuries. The Statutes of Mortmain were two enactments, in 1279 and 1290, by King Edward I of England aimed at preserving the kingdom''s revenues by preventing land from passing out of the legal system and jurisdiction of national law. The Statutes were meant to re-establish the prohibition against donating land to the Church for purposes of avoiding feudal services which had been hinted at in the Magna Carta in 1215 and specifically defined in the Great Charter of 1217.',
'De donis conditionalibus is the chapter of the English Statutes of Westminster (1285) which originated the law of "Entail". Since the passing of the statute an estate given to a man and the heirs of his body has been known as an ''estate tail'', or an ''estate in fee tail'' (feudum talliatum), the word tail being derived from the French tailler, to cut, the inheritance being by the statute cut down and confined to the heirs of the body. The operation of the statute soon produced innumerable evils -children, grew disobedient when they knew they could not be set aside; farmers were deprived of their leases; creditors were defrauded of their debts; innumerable latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of the land they had fairly bought; treasons also were encouraged, as estates tail were not liable to forfeiture longer than for the tenant''s life. On the other hand, by limiting inheritance to the eldest son, the other issue were forced to seek employment elsewhere, thus, it has been argued, preventing the growth of a landed caste. The professions of the church, the army and the law were constantly recruited from the younger sons of landed families, preventing the gap between nobility and the commoners.',
'As a result of the Norman Conquest some French religious orders held substantial property through their daughter monasteries in England. Some of these were merely agricultural estates with a single foreign monk in residence to supervise things, others were rich foundations in their own right (e.g. Lewes Priory which was a daughter of Cluny and answered to the abbot of that great French house). Owing to the fairly constant state of war between England and France in the Late Middle Ages successive English governments had objected to money going overseas to France from these Alien Priories (''trading with the enemy'') whence the French king might get hold of it, and to foreign prelates having jurisdiction over English monasteries. Furthermore, after 1378, French monasteries (and hence alien priories dependent on them) maintained allegiance to the continuing Avignon Papacy, and so their suppression was supported by the rival Roman Popes, conditional on all confiscated monastic property eventually being redirected into other religious uses. The king''s officers first sequestrated the assets of the Alien Priories in 1295-1303 under Edward I, and the same thing happened repeatedly for long periods over the course of the 14th century, most particularly in the reign of Edward III. Those Alien Priories that had functioning communities were forced to pay large sums to the king, while those that were mere estates were confiscated and run by royal officers, the proceeds going to the king''s pocket. Such estates were a valuable source of income for the Crown in its French wars. Some of the Alien Priories were allowed to become naturalised (for instance Castle Acre Priory), on payment of heavy fines and bribes, but for the rest their fates were sealed when Henry V dissolved them by act of Parliament in 1414.',
'Bastard feudalism is a term that has been used to describe feudalism in the Late Middle Ages of England. Its main characteristic is military, political, legal, or domestic service in return for money, office, and/or authority. The gentry began to think of themselves as the men of their lord rather than of the king. A shift in English history took place under Edward I when the feudal levy was replaced with royal payment in return for military service by the great magnates who willingly served the king. Thus, instead of vassals rendering military service when required by the lord, they paid a portion of their income into the lord''s treasury. In turn the lord would supplement the owed military service with hired retainers, a sort of private army in full time service to the lord. In return for becoming retainers, the gentry would expect to rely on his lord''s authority in local and national politics. This practice was known as maintenance. The retainer might wear his lord''s livery badge or the grander form, a livery collar, which could be very useful in a courtroom. Under a weak king, such as Henry VI, the rivalries of magnates might spill over from the courtroom to armed confrontations, thereby perverting justice. Because they were rarely kept under arms for long periods, noble retinues were not private armies. Lacking standing armies, kings relied on noble retinues for the military forces they required to conduct wars or crush internal rebellions. Under an inadequate king like Henry VI, ambitious or disaffected magnates like Richard Duke of York or Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick could use their network of servants and retainers to defy or even control the crown. Groups of gentry already coming to blows over local issues, inevitably attached themselves to different patrons. Their private feuds were continued under their leaders'' banners and transferred to the battlefields of the Wars of the Roses.',

'The term quintain (O. Fr. quintaine/quintaina, from Lat. quintana, a street between the fifth and sixth maniples of a camp, where warlike exercises took place), also known as pavo (or peacock), was often used to refer collectively to a number of lance games, often used as training for jousting, where the competitor would attempt to strike an object with his lance, sword or other weapon. The common object was a shield or board on a pole (usually referred to, confusingly, as ''the quintain''), although a mannikin was sometimes used. It was not unknown for a seated armoured knight to act as the target. This game was open to all, popular with young men of all classes. While the use of horses aided in training for the joust, the game could be played on foot, using a wooden horse or on boats (popular in 12th-century London). This military training tended to keep the lads out of trouble!',
'Hastilude is a generic term used in the Middle Ages to refer to many kinds of martial games. The word comes from the Latin hastiludium, literally "lance game"''. By the 14th century, the term usually excluded tournaments and was used to describe the other games collectively; this seems to have coincided with the increasing preference for ritualistic and individualistic games over the traditional mêlée style. It draw spectators from afar, which allowed trade and fairs, but also brought crime, prositution and the spread of diseases from travellers shacked into rough conditions.',
'Roger of Hoveden (1174 - 1201), an English chronicler., described tournaments as "military exercises carried out, not in the spirit of hostility (nullo interveniente odio), but solely for practice and the display of prowess (pro solo exercitio, atque ostentatione virium)." During the Early Middle Ages such cavalry games were still central to military training as is evidenced by Louis and Charles'' military games at Worms in 843. At this event, recorded by Nithard, the initial chasing and fleeing was followed by a general melee of all combatants. But the tournament, properly so called, does not appear in Europe before the 11th century. Medieval people themselves devised myths about its origins. A chronicler of Tours in the late twelfth century records the death, in 1066, of an Angevin baron named Geoffroi de Preulli, who supposedly "devised (invenit) tournaments." Tournaments centred on the melee, a general fight where the knights were divided into two sides and came together in a charge (MFr ''estor''). Jousting, a single combat of two knights riding at each other, was a component of the tournament, but was never its main feature. Knights would come from all over Christendom as a means to make a name for themselves, advertise their services to foreign royalties who might wish to recruit them into their retinues or offices of command. It was also a chance to court princesses.',
'The pas d''armes or passage of arms was a type of chivalric hastilude that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. It involved a knight or group of knights (tenans) who would stake out a traveled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass (venans or "comers") must first fight, or be disgraced. If a traveling venan did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the venan chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way. There are many thousands of accounts of pas d''armes during this period. One notable and special account is that of Suero de Quiñones who in 1433 established the Passo Honroso ("Pass[age] of Honour") at the Órbigo bridge in Castile. This road was used by pilgrims all over Europe on the way to shrine at Santiago de Compostela and it was June when thousands would pass. Suero and ten knights promised to fight 300 times ("break 300 lances") before leaving the pas d''armes. He and his men fought for over a month, an account of which is left to us in great detail by town notary Don Luis Alonso Luengo who kept a first-hand chronicle (later published as Libro del Passo honroso). After 166 battles Suero and his men were so injured they could not continue and declared the mission complete. Although it sounds very honourable, this manner of picking fights from every man of sergeant and noble class meant that vendettas and claims on each others'' estates quickly descended into turmoil.',

'Feudal household, the lord''s core military power allowing him to deploy his kinsfolk and extended manservants and their retinues. The establishment of a Maisnade was often a prolonged procedure whereby newly appointed titles and new domains issued from the King or other great masters such as the counts, required time to become accepted into the aristocracy. This ''new blood'' would need to assert its authority and usually marry into other noble houses to affirm its legitimacy. From these maisnade would arise the barons and knights of the county.',
'The core centre of a lord''s military control, usually the direct area which his castle could dominate, or within a day''s ride of his castle. The more strongholds he held in the vicinity of each other, the more readily his troops could move from one stronghold to the next keeping total control over the district or districts in his grasp. The châtelain was originally, in Carolingian times, an official of the count; with the development of feudalism the office became a fief, and so ultimately hereditary. In this as in other respects the châtelain was the equivalent of the viscount; sometimes the two titles were combined, but more usually in those provinces where there were châtelains there were no viscounts, and vice versa. Changes to this system were most marked in the cities, where the struggle for power of the châtelain depended on the success with which he could assert himself against his feudal superior, lay or ecclesiastical, or, from the 12th century onwards, against the rising power of the communes. The châtellenie (casteliania), or jurisdiction of the châtelain, was a territorial division for certain judicial and administrative purposes.',
'The administrative network of baillages was established in the 13th century, based on the earlier medieval fiscal and tax divisions (the ''baillie'') which had been used by earlier sovereign princes. A bailli was the king’s administrative representative during the ancien régime in northern France, where the bailli was responsible for the application of justice and control of the administration and local finances in his baillage. In southern France, the term generally used was sénéchal who held office in the sénéchaussée. Philip II Augustus of France (1180-1223), an able and ingenious administrator who founded the central institutions on which the French monarchy''s system of power would be based, prepared the expansion of the royal demesne through his appointment of baillis in the king''s land (the domaine royal), based on medieval fiscal and tax divisions (the "baillie") which had been used by earlier sovereign princes (such as the Duke of Normandy). In Flanders, the count appointed similar bailiffs, called the baljuw — a term directly derived from bailli.',
'The Marches were usually the domains of barons within a County or Duchy. The regional French masters such as those of Toulouse, Orleans and Blois were all dependent on their lesser vassals- the knights and barons to defend the local territories from rebels and from rival Counts as well as foreign invaders, at least in the initial stages. This feudal service centred predominantly around the ''bailliage et gardia'', and the garrisons of castles.',
'This was the call to arms for the locals, forming garrisons, militias and if needed levies to garrison strongholds. This enabled the lord''s household troops to move move freely on active and aggressive manoevres such as ost (foreign campaigns) and chevauchée (attacks, ambushes and raids) whilst lighter troops kept control of the district from the strongholds.',
'A military-judicial region, usually under the Royal Demesne but could exist in vassal counties too. These were governed by officials who worked parallel to the civil administrators in the towns and were repsonsible for maintaining a body for the standing or levied army. These reserves would include men from the local gentries such as sergeants and knights as well as men drawn from the local militias. The Prévôté maximised the military potential of the region being able to provide constant checks and logistic support on the manpower available, this allowed the region to maintain a full battle-readiness which greatly added to the defensive strength of the faction''s control. For instance, nine towns of the Massif region provided over 3000 sergeants during 1253 when needed, thanks to the Prévôté.',
'A system of mutual help between great knights, counts and lords. Rather than serving as vassals to one another, later communes felt the need to abandon the expensive ammassing of large standing armies and garrisons in favour of maintaining small professional troops and mercenaries. These would rally to each other''s protection during a crisis, pooling their collective resources. The system was far more cost-efficient but had obvious drawbacks to security and was often used to full effect in conspiracies and political betrayals. The castles and strongholds used by the treatied forces were no longer under direct feudal control but became part of a freehold league property. In time many of these were taken by rebel barons, fell into disuse or were merely inherited by militias. However the community was strengthened by this even if the lords were weakened.',
'This law declared that if the King of France found the realm in danger from his enemies, all his subjects were to come to his aid as quickly as they could. If they failed to do so, they were considered guilty of "dereliction of duty...since no one must fail the ruler in such a great matter." In reality, the Princeps namque transcended feudal ties, making army service and support the business of the realm at large. With this royal and feudal legal background in mind, the role of the fiefs, the towns, and populace at large in army maintenance was put to the test. Whilst it had social and legal right, it was naturally contested by disloyal or independent subjects that argued over what actually constituted a threat to the Realm or was in fact a private army for the King. It was a huge asset in the rapid response to war.',
'Suzerainty occurs where a region or people is a tributary to a more powerful entity which controls its foreign affairs while allowing the tributary vassal state some limited domestic autonomy. The dominant entity in the suzerainty relationship, or the more powerful entity itself, is called a suzerain. The late Middle French ''sousserain estaige'' was a military summons of the realm by the Dauphin. It enabled him to quickly gather large forces in the event of a mass invasion, or military crisis such as during the 100 Years War. This estaige included the Maréchaussée which was the office and powers of the Grand Marshall of France, the Commander in Chief of the national and royal armies. It was a huge asset in rapid response to war.',

'Islands off Greenland were sighted by Gunnbjörn Ulfsson when he was blown off course while sailing from Norway to Iceland, probably in the early 10th century. During the 980s, explorers from Iceland and Norway arrived at mainland Greenland and, finding the land unpopulated, settled on the southwest coast. At the time of the Norse settlement, the inner regions of the long fjords where the settlements were located were very different from today. Excavations show that there were considerable birch woods with birch trees up to 4 to 6 meters high in the area around the inner parts of the Tunuliarfik- and Aniaaq-fjords, the central area of the Eastern settlement, and the hills were grown with grass and willow brushes. This was due to the medieval climate optimum. The Norse soon effected the landscape by mass deforestation, much like what was happening in Iceland to use as building material and for heating and by extensive sheep and goat grazing during summer and winter. The climate in Greenland was much warmer during the first centuries of settlement but became increasingly colder during the 14th and 15th centuries with the approaching period of colder weather known as the Little Ice Age. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for a period of three years, due to a murder. He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain lands as his own. He then returned to Iceland to bring people to settle on Greenland. The date of establishment of the colony is said, in the Icelandic sagas, to have been AD 985, when 25 ships left with Erik the Red. Only 14 arrived safely in Greenland.',
'Brattahlíð (anglicised as Brattahlid) was Erik the Red''s estate in the Eastern Settlement Viking colony he established in south-western Greenland toward the end of the 10th century. The present settlement of Qassiarsuk, approximately 5 km (3.1 mi) southwest from the Narsarsuaq settlement, is now located in its place. The site is located about 96 km (60 mi) from the ocean, at the head of the Tunulliarfik Fjord, and hence sheltered from ocean storms. Erik and his descendants lived there until late in the 15th century. The name Brattahlid means "the steep slope". It was one of the major villages on Greenland.',
'At Brattahlíð stood the first church in the New World: Þjóðhildarkirkja Thjodhild''s church, actually a small chapel. It was the oldest Church of the Greenland colony. Erik the Red himself did not profess Christianity, but his wife, Þjóðhildur who owned the church clearly was. The churchyard has tombstones, with a cross cut only on one of them. On another stand engraved the runes for "Ingibjørg''s Grave". The remains infer that despite being a clearly Christian centre, paganism and the Old Ways were very well-entrenched throughout Greenland''s history.',
'The Western Settlement (Old Norse: Vestribyggð) was the smaller of the two main areas of Greenland settled in around 985 AD by Norse farmers from Iceland (the other settlement being the Eastern Settlement). Much less is known about the Western settlement than the Eastern settlement, very little mention in the written sources and no direct descriptions in any of the medieval sources on Greenland. The Norse settlement is last mentioned in the mid-14th century, when a traveller from the Eastern Settlement found only vacant, abandoned farms it is thought this was due to the stavation and extreme cold suddenly fallen on Northern Europe during the Little Ice Age. Ivar Bardarson, writing to the Bishop of Bergen, describing conditions he observed sometime between 1341-60, found amongst other things remains of dogs that had clearly been slaughtered for food telling us that things were not only desperate but all other food sources, livestock and vegetable had been exhausted. At its peak, the Western Settlement probably had 1,000 inhabitants. Its smaller size was due to the shorter growing season. The largest of the Western Settlement farms was Sandnes. Ruins of almost 95 farms have been found in the Western settlement.',
'The Eastern Settlement (Old Norse: Eystribygð, Icelandic: Eystribyggð) was the largest and first of the three areas of Greenland, settled in approximately 985 AD by Norse farmers from Iceland (the other settlements being the Western and Middle Settlements). At its peak it contained approximately 4,000 inhabitants. The last written record from the Eastern Settlement is of a wedding in 1408; thus it ceased to be occupied after around 1410-1420 AD, about 60–70 years longer than the Western Settlement. Despite its name, the Eastern Settlement was more south than east of its companion and, like the Western Settlement, was located on the southwestern tip of Greenland at the head of long fjords: Tunulliarfik Fjord or Eiriksfjord, Igaliku or Einarsfjord, Sermilik Fjord, to name a few. Approximately 500 groups of ruins of Norse farms are found in the area, including 16 church ruins giving a population of roughly 5000. The economy of the medieval Norse settlements was based on livestock farming - mainly sheep and cattle, with significant supplement from seal hunting. A climate deterioration in the 14th Century may have increased the demand for winter fodder and at the same time decreased productivity of hay meadows. Isotope analysis of bones excated at archaeological investigations in the Norse settlements have found that fishing played an increasing economic role towards the end of the settlement''s life. While the diet of the first settlers consisted of 80% agricultural products and 20% marine food, from the 14th century the Greenland Norsemen had 50–80% of their diet from the sea indicating perhaps more desperate poverty and signs of stavation.',
'Hvalsey was the largest settlement in Greenland, it was the site of the Royal Estate and the largest church of the entire colony.',
'Hvalsey Church (Danish: Hvalsø Kirke) was situated in the fjord of Hvalsey, not far from the largest town in the south of Greenland. The architecture seems very related to similar Norse buildings from the 14th century. The church is in the region which the Norse named "Asturbyggd", the Eastern Settlement, when the Vikings settled in Greenland in around 985. There are burials under the walls of this church from earlier phases of use but older churches have not been identified at this site. The Hvalsey church is mentioned in several late medieval documents as one of the 10-14 parish churches in the Eastern Settlement. The church was still in use in 1408. It was the most prominent church on Greenland and was the main religious site until the Bishop''s seat at Garðar was founded.',
'According to the Icelandic Book of Settlements (Landnámabok), the farmstead was established by Erik the Red''s uncle, Þorkell Farserkur in the late 10th century. The farmstead was originally named Þjóðhildarstaðir. In the 14th century, it belonged to the Kings of Norway: "Næst Einarsfirði liggr Hvalseyjarfjörðr. Þar er kirkja, sem heitir Hvalseyjarfjarðarkirkja. Hún á allan fjörðinn ok svá allan Kambstaðafjörð, sem er næstr. Í þessum firði stendur bær mikill, sem konungi tilheyrir og heitir Þjóðhildarstaðir." Beside Einar''s Firth lies Hvalsey Fjord. There is a church there called Hvalsey Fjord Church. It serves the entire fjord and all of Kambstad Fjord as well, which is beside it. On this firth stands a large farmstead, which belongs to the king and is called Thjodhild''s Stead. The farmstead was a major center in South Greenland. The site, which has the ruins of two stone great halls, had an additional 14 houses close to a churchhouse. The old hall, which is 14 metres (46 ft) long and 3 metres (9.8 ft) or 4 metres (13 ft) wide, is in the middle of the ruins. The well-preserved newer hall measures 8 metres (26 ft) by 5 metres (16 ft).',
'In the sagas it is told that Sokki Þórisson, a wealthy farmer of the Brattahlíð area launched the idea of a separate bishop for Greenland in the early 12th century. He got the approval of the Norwegian King. Most of the clergy would come from Norway. The first bishop of Garðar, Arnaldur, was ordained by the Archbishop of Lund in 1124. He arrived in Greenland in 1126. In the same year he started with the construction of the cathedral, devoted to St. Nicholas, patron saint of sailors. The diocese was first assigned to the Archbishopric of Bremen. The diocese of Garðar was subject to the Archbishop of Lund from 1126-1152. In 1152 the diocese of Greenland, as well as those of Iceland, the Isle of Man, the Orkney Islands, the Faroer Islands became subject to the newly-established Archdiocese of Nidaros. Bishop Arnaldur returned to Norway in 1150 and became bishop of Hamar in 1152. His successor was Jón Knútur, who served from 1153-1186. The third bishop was Jón Árnason (nicknamed Smyrill), who took office in 1189. In 1202-1203 he went on a pilgrimage to Rome and met the pope. He died in Garðar in 1209 and was buried there, most likely in the Northern Chapel of the cathedral. The next bishop, Þór Helgi, arrived in Greenland in 1212 and was bishop until his death in 1230. In 1234 Nikulás was ordained, but he arrived in Greenland only in 1239. He died in 1242. Ólafur was ordained in the same year, but arrived only in 1247. He remained bishop until the mid 1280s. He was abroad from 1264–1280, thus hardly serving in his own diocese. The next bishop was Þór Bokki who stayed in Garðar from 1289 until his return to Norway in 1309. The next one to serve was bishop Árni, who served from 1315-1347. Due to the poor communication between Greenland and Norway, it was assumed that he had died and a new bishop (Jón Skalle) was ordained in 1343. When it was discovered that the bishop was still alive, he resigned and never went to Greenland. After the death of bishop Árni in 1347 it took a long time for the next bishop to arrive, mainly due to the worsening communications. Bishop Álfur was ordained in 1368 and served as last bishop of Garðar until 1378. Garðar Cathedral, was a cross-shaped church built of sandstone in the 12th century. The maximum length is 27 m, the width 16 m. There are also two large barns on the site with the capacity to have held up to 160 cows. The see ran the largest farm in Greenland.The Greenland diocese disappeared in the 1400s, when the ship departures from Norway stopped.',

'Chapter house, although the establishment of an Order was a Chapter House of sorts it was usually referred to as a Domus. This Domus was typically a chapel monastery, naturally being a militarised order in addition to the farmland around the House to provide for the monks (sergeants, knights and laymen) it was neccessary to have grazing pastures for the warhorses and training grounds for the troops. The stables and armouries were typically adjoined with a blacksmith and even over time a small village would grow up outside of the Domus and its estates to support the chapter, all of this formed a small settlement or ''capital'' which acted as a proper base of logisitics for the Order in the region.',
'Mansion Estate. As a Chapter House grew in size and the forces it housed grew in number, the civilian support around the ''barracks'' would also increase exponentially. Typically the chapter would require its own estates much like any other monastery, hwoever due to the logistics of running a small military cohort there was a long list of administrative duties that had to be considered. The Mansio acted as an office for the accounts, records and provision of law over the estate, although it provided jobs for the civilians in the area it also ate up considerable tracts of arable land from the populace. Furthermore being an ecclesiastical institution it was land and manpower that was tax exempt, in fact it actually drained tax from the region due to the Church tithe.',
'A preceptory was historically the headquarters of any of the various orders of Christian Knights, such as the Knights Hospitaller and Templar, within a given geographic area. Governed by a preceptor, who was answerable to the Grand Master of the respective order. A preceptory''s main focus would be its church and accommodation for the brethren. Like any monastery it acted as a religious base in the province, but a preceptory was more in line with an Abbey in fact, so it had considerable effect in its locality. With such a large establishment its side-effects on the regional economy were increased, but on the other hand so was the power and efficiency of the military aspect. Local knights and sergeants would pay into the Order in order to receive a regular pay and more stable livelihood than trying to run their own estates. This is one reason the Orders became to popular and powerful, in fact they impacted on the power of the kings since his vassals were giving up their feudal service to him, their feudal command over the peasantry and donating their estates to the Order -making them Donati.',
'The Commandry was to all intents and purposes a Preceptory. It was a large base of operations and administration for an Order. Usually seen as the smallest division of an Order''s powers it was also its foundation- for it was via the network of these bases that recruitment, training, income and political influence emerged. What set a Commandry apart from a straightforward Preceptory was the heightened emphasis on military command. The Teutonic Order called their Commanderies; Kommende or Komturei which also has the meaning of ''office'' stemming from the French comptoir from the Latin computare - or ''calculate''. Therefore Commandries can be seen as essential headquarters for regional Order forces.',
'A keep or tower, this basic fortification was the prime defensive expansion of a commandry. Keeps were common structures in Europe, probably descended from Roman structures in design and function. A tower had natural practical benefits of allowing a raised lookout to see potential threats approaching, it also allowed missiles to be directed with better accuracy and power on attackers. The added pyschological effect of a tall imposing building increased belief in government in the area.',
'Fortification. A castellum was a small Roman detached fort used as a watch tower or signal station. The Latin word castellum is the source of the English word "castle", and was used in medieval times to cover a wide range of military defences. In the context of Militarised Monastic Orders, a castellum was major base of operations, usually found in frontier provinces such as the frontlines against Muslims or pagans in the Baltics, Iberia or the Holy Land. Naturally the cost of funding not only the contstruction of such a large site, but the manning of military and civilian support was very high. An Order''s castellum would include all the structrures needed to maintain, equip, feed and train a crusader army. A ruler would build such structures for the Orders, to encourage them to prosper and garrison his frontiers. Since the Orders were largely self-contained once they were up and running it was something of an investment.',
'Citadel. The Latin word castrum, was used by the ancient Romans to mean buildings or plots of land reserved to or constructed for use as a military defensive position. In classical Latin the word castra always means "great legionary encampment", both "marching", "temporary" ones and the "fortified permanent" ones, while the diminutive form castellum was used for the smaller forts, which were usually, but not always, occupied by the auxiliary units and used as logistic bases for the legions, as explained by Vegetius. In Latin the term Castrum is much more frequently used as proper name of geographical locations. In the Middle Ages, Castrum or Castrorum was naturally widely used in a variety of meanings, but in the context of the Militarised Monastic Orders it represented the paramount tier of operational bases such as the famous Templar headquarters in the Holy Land: Karak. A castrum was more than just a walled, towered structure it was a self-contained city including Horreae (granaries), Valetudinarium (hospital), Veterinarium (for horses), Fabrica ("workshop", metals and wood) and the Retentura ("stretching to the rear") was also a safekeep for plunder and a prison for hostages and high-ranking enemy captives. Of course more mundane amenities also existed in planned locations within the walls such as stone ovens for baking bread, latrines for hygiene, wells and irrigation ditches in hotter climates to augment agriculture.',
'Though it is incredibly common for peasant boys to learn how to string a bow as they grow up, any lord seeking to field a unit of archers or crossbowmen will first need to employ a professional Bowyer. Essentially a specialised carpenter, a bowyer has all the equipment needed to shape and treat bow wood, twine and resin for bow strings, as well as a healthy supply of bird feathers, for the rather mundane task of fletching countless arrows.',
'An Archery Range is a necessary investment for any lord seeking to train professional missile troops, rather than rely upon militia-level training with local peasants. Improvements to the range include much more challenging targets to practise on, officer’s quarters, and a larger bowyer’s workshop outfitted to manufacture superior weaponry, worthy of highly trained soldiers.',
'The interior of a Archery Range''s workshop can make strong men retch. This disgusting process involves a slurry made from dog faeces (called, ironically, "pure") to produce even the finest leathers. However, leather armour can protect men from blows and bruises, and may even turn aside a blade.',

'Fashioning a barrel of wrought iron bars that can hold its shape properly requires precision on a level that standard smiths are simply not equipped to deal with, and the Gunsmith is the first specialist workshop equipped to produce such a piece. As an entry-level structure pioneering a new design, gunsmiths are only large enough to fashion one cannon design, that of the bombard.',
'A Naval aviz allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the Horsebreeders'' Guild to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',
'Gunsmith Guild outside of a settlement are somewhat opulent in the Medieval age, but offer the best possible surface for both armies and baronial_estatess to traverse quickly.

'In the Middle Ages each province had a character of infrastructure, typically a region would specialist in agriculture or in a series of urban satellite settlements. Of course, this is not to say that a region with towns had no farmlands- only that the focus of development and government, as well as the predominant type of scoiety was centred around different ways of life. In many localities, rulers would give ''Town Charters'', ''City Charters'', form ''Royal Burghs'' or grant specific trading rights, laws and tax freedoms as well as tolls and customs depending on the type of commerce in a province. A region that produced a great deal of a single commodity such as wool for export could be taxed at a higher or lower rate depending on the control a ruler wanted to apply to his local businesses. In other aspects, a region could have a mainly agricultural focus which although grew more slowly than the population centres grouped into towns in time the benefits of a highly developed farming community could be a great asset to a realm. Agricultural areas were typically much more stratified than the bourgeois (city folk), since peasants served landlords in a pyramid system. Life for farmworkers was very tough and poverty could be extreme, serfs were basically slaves and in poor conditions, peasants would frequently revolt. However as manors and estates developed around the households of the landed gentry life improved, encouraged trade, business and pastoral culture deep in the heart of a province. Towns focussed the population which allowed the concentration of culture and crafts. Where people were amassed together in one place, traders and merchants were more likely to congregate because they knew they had buyers for their commerce. Similarly, craftsmen and artisans were also abundant in these urban sites. Taxation was much easier to apply since the population could be more easily controlled in a concentrated area. However, populations boomed where people lived in such close quarters of each other and health, hygiene and law could easily spiral out of control as these secondary settlements advanced.',
'Hamlets were small settlements which were dependant on farmlands and usually were run by the communities of the hamlets as a collective. Hamlets could also grow up around trading crossroads such as by a ford in a river or around a natural resource such as mines, quarries or hunting grounds. People generally considered themselves free from the oppression of landlords and were the beginnings of commercial centres.',
'Villages would attract traders and merchants from the provincial capital, establishing a network around the major city and into the countryside at these specific communities where population were more densely packed than in the open landscapes of farmlands. Villages allowed concentrated points where people would seek work, and come to buy and sell where they knew there was trade.',
'Secondary towns could spring up in a province as satellites around a regional capital. A wealthy province would have trade centres in an entire network, covering a variety of specialist trades. However grouping people into small concentrated population centres had its drawbacks, since health was an issue especially multiplied by growth rates, furthermore the merchants who had become a kind of urban nobility resented taxation -these burghers or bourgeois often themselves formed or funded the militias, and emerged to challenge the counts and dukes. Nonetheless the benefits of having concentrated populations was the ability to set and to extract taxes more efficiently- as long as the people could be properly governed and policed. Crime was a further issue in urban areas, towns would attract poor people and those who had no means to earn a wage in trade other than theft or prostitution.',
'Medieval cities were always walled settlements, these were naturally defensive structures but had the added bonus of keeping the population inside the walls! Policing and taxation as well as other forms of control were much easier when the lords and their men could look down on the streets from the walls. However, a city could easily grow quicker than its walls could expand. Typically secondary settlements such as small towns and villages which had grown up around manors or small farmsteads some distance outside of a major city could in fact find themselves merging with the city as it grew. A river port as a trade outlet to a city, for instance, could quickly find itself as part of the city itself, transformed from a small riverside town into wharfs and warehouses. City quarters outside of the city walls were usually considered dangerous places, both due to bad law and hygiene. Suburbs grew up organically out of shacks and slums, usually based on the foundations of old manorial estates. This was in contrast to the streets inside the city walls which were developed by design and set up in quarters where different social classes were designated. Sewerage and human waste was merely dumped in the streets in medieval times, rubbish and effluent would float along the streets out of the side gates and down into the ditches (a primitive sort of moat) outside the walls. The poorest burials sites were also near to the suburbs, usually mass graves. During times of pestilence or war, a city would shut its gates to the poorfolk outside of the walls. Nonetheless it was a sign of a prosperous city that so many were drawn from far afield to seek a living even in the slums, and taxation and trade was still possible here after all.',
'Serfs were no more than slaves, they were at the very bottom of the social ladder. The word serf is related to ''service'' and they were in the feudal system in direct service to the landlords. Forced labor of serfs were bound to a hereditary plot of land owned by a lord in return for protection and the right to work on fields they leased from their landlords to maintain their own subsistence. Serfdom involved not only work in owner''s fields, but his mines, forests and roads. A freeman became a serf usually through force or necessity. Sometimes freeholders or allodial owners were intimidated into dependency by the greater physical and legal force of a local baron. Often a few years of crop failure, a war or brigandage might leave a person unable to make his own way. In such a case a bargain was struck with the lord. In exchange for protection, service was required, in payment and/or with labour. The majority of the population existed in serfdom or peasantry, in 11th century England freemen made up only 10% of the population.',
'Peasants were a slightly higher social level than serfs, but they were still very poor with very few civil rights. This made them prone to rebellions, especially since they made up the majority of the population and in their view at least held the true power of a province. The word ''peasant'' has come to identify an entire culture, and their way of life is often typified as iconic of the Middle Ages. What we term ''peasants'' were actually often bordars: persons ranking below a villein and above a serf in the social hierarchy of a manor, holding just enough land to feed a family (about 5 acres or 2 hectares) and were required to provide labour on the demesne on specified days of the week.',
'Villeins had more rights and higher status than the lowest serf, but were under a number of legal restrictions that differentiated them from freemen. Villeins generally rented small homes, with or without land. As part of the contract with their landlord, they were expected to spend some of their time farming the lord''s fields. The rest of their time was spent farming their own land. Like other types of serfs, they were required to provide other services, possibly in addition to paying rent of money or goods, such as military service as levies or maintenance work on roads or building. Villeins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord''s consent. However, in other regards, they were free men in the eyes of the law, for villeins were generally able to have their own property, unlike slaves. In many medieval countries, a villein could theoretically gain freedom by escaping to a city and living there for more than a year; and this was in fact a common occurrence especially with the rise of urban centres. But this naturally involved the loss of land and agricultural livelihood and these villeins newly arrived in a city were normally unskilled workes with no trade or craftsmanship skills and therefore were more likely to take to crime for survival, which gave the alternate spelling "villain" its modern meaning.',
'Freeholdings, were land held by freemen. In Europe they made up no more than 10% of the entire population and that included the nobility. Most freemen were not nobles but were of the status of sergeants, who formed clans and had recognisable households. Sergeants and other freemen would usually make up the top ranks of tenant farmers but were in fact themselves subject to the regional and local lords such as barons, just as the barons were subject to counts and dukes, and they in turn were subjects to kings. For this reason sergeants were often given the latin gloss ''servientes'' or servants, which can be quite misleading. Freemen were on the whole a key segment of the feudal order whereby nobility and peasantry could be mediated and taxation, law as well as freedoms could be enacted. They were in many ways the original middle class.',
'Encouraging markets in a region is not difficult nor expensive, it only takes a little organisation and some financial sponsorship to draw in merchants who then take it upon themselves to exploit any local means of business, whether it be natural or human resources.',
'Investing funds into militias across the region is a good way to protect the peasants and villages across the landscape, they take it upon themselves to help their lords to defend and maintain military strength. It aids law and even taxation, allowing a free men to always be on standby.',
'Sponsoring fairs in the countryside and villages of a province brings less direct impact and income than a fair in a large town or regional capital- nonetheless the overall boost to commerce and happiness is worth it. Although banditry and disease are encouraged by the black market, movement of merchants and the exploitation of the weak for hard cash. -There''s always someone who has to ruin things for everyone else!',
'Serjeanty originated in the assignation of an estate in land on condition of the performance of a certain duty other than knight-service, usually the discharge of duties in the household of king or noble. It ranged from service in the king''s host, distinguished only by equipment from that of the knight, to petty renders scarcely distinguishable from those of the rent-paying tenant or socager. Serjeants (servientes) are already entered as a distinct class in Domesday Book (1086), though not in all cases differentiated from the barons, who held by knight-service. The majority of freeholders, squires and lesser gentry made up the sergeantry class, and they were entitled to bear their own arms at least in the early medieval period. As the concept of piety enlarged, the gap between baronial knights and free sergeants widened drastically, nonetheless they remained the backbone of most professional fighting forces and made up the bulk of the officers. Sergeantry combined with third level conscription allows European armies to recruit soldiers of the sergeant class.',
'Knights were generally of the baronial class, each man held an estate in feudal service to a lord which had military, judicial and economic duties.Tenure by barony was the higher feudal tenure of a lord who had subordinate knights. Originally, a barony was the land subject to a baron and could, in England after the Norman Conquest, consist of estates scattered throughout the country or in several regions (see, for example, the barony of the earl of Pembroke, with estates in England, Ireland, and Normandy). A medieval barony might comprise more than one manor or fief, and the principal manor often had a minor castle, however a barony constituted an administrative division of a country, of lower rank and importance than a county -barons were subject to the counts and dukes of the aristocracy. Combined with the fourth level of conscription this allows European armies to recruit knights and other soldiers from the higher levels of society.',

'In order for a region to have the full infrastructure to re-equip and maintain a large military force with armour, swords or even shoe hundreds of warhorses and packhorses on a regular basis- there needed to be a simpler basic foundation. Without proper access to more civil trades such as forestry- there could be no blacksmithing. Forestry was only one of the crafts that was needed to support more developed military logistics. Foresters would not only select, cultivate and shape wood for use in weapons such as spears and warmachines but also for making the buildings that would be used for firepits and furnaces that blacksmiths would need. Foresters would also constantly deliver charcoal, created via a highly skilled and patient process of smouldering wood in a confined container. Charcoal was the primary fuel used in forges that blacksmiths used to maintain and even, steady temperature in the fire to allow him to form his ironwork. Once the basic trades, crafts and merchants were in place- then the development of military support could begin.',
'Producing leather tans and hides for armour was a lengthy and highly skilled process, that if needed to equip an army -not just with simple body armour, but with grips for weapons such as swordhilts, making saddles, bridles, straps for steel harnesses, quivers for bows, etc a whole factory was required to support such a demand. A guild of tanners would combine the various tanners shops in a settlement and govern them to work in cohesion, to delegate work fairly and ensure a proper quota of quality and quantity was fulfilled for the local lords.',

'Medieval Swedish farming administration was highly advanced and it allowed a very productive system of agriculture and taxation until the Black Death when many of the villages and farming areas were left totally unpopulated and the landscape reverted to wilderness. During the 1100s, perhaps due to the centralisation of the kingdom, various means of partition and evaluation of the land was made. Most prominent of these was the Marklandsvärderingen which was generally based only in Svealand but had similar systems in Götaland such as Attungen. Both systems measured out the agricultural worth of each area of land, the richness of the soil and its ability to produce good yields of harvest. Each small set of fields or ''Åkrar'' (acres) were sized to each deliver the same amount of produce. Lesser valued soils would be larger territories and wealthy areas would be smaller but all would more or less be able to give a comparable income. Attungen refined this process by allotting the farmlands into partitions of 8 amongst the village. This system was in fact much older than Marklandsvärderingen, and had its roots in prehistory. The new administration however did enforce new regulations, brought into place by the farmers themselves through the Thing. Sowing and harvesting was now a communal practice, this improved the efficiency of all work but also avoided former issues of a farmer moving the boundaries of his fields into another man''s estates. The proverb ''tomt är tegs moder'' originated at this time, which means ''the estate is the mother of the yield.''',
'One of the three types of land ownership in the Swedish Middle Ages was granting land to the Church. When the Church governed a district it took the claim of the Crown''s taxes from that land. All land in the kingdom was taxable by the Crown for at least 10% of its worth and annual harvests, it was only the donated land to the Church which for religious reasons could not be taxed. This was the standard practice for most of the known world in fact. In Sweden, Churchland had a very powerful effect on the local economy however since taxation was ironically much more stringent than in other districts- but this was tax only recieved by the Church and not one penny reached the Crown. The farmers had less ability by law to discuss the various taxation levels as they did with the king at the Thing. In fact the farmers had no means to parley with the Church administration at all, to question the authority of the Bishop was a religious offence tantamount to heresy. The Crown donated the land hereditarily to the Church also for religious reasons, usualy to gain more authority with local Church nobles- such as having a Bishop on the king''s side. The Bishops therefore became personally very wealthy, much more so than other nobles and were able to keep their own armies and command a great presence in politics. For this reason, the Crown''s donations to the Church in hopes of gaining Papal authority often backfired, but the Crown could always threaten a Bishop with removing the land rights from his control. Historically Henry VIII did this England with the famous ''Dissolution of the Monasteries'' gaining him a net value of 60 million florins, what is less well-known is that this had numerous historical precedents and was by no means beyond the power of the monarchs of Europe to keep the Church in check.',
'Petter was St Peter, or the Papacy, Petterpenning was the act of submitting ''pennies to St Peter'' -it was an extended Church tax that was rather harsh on the local community but did give the Crown more authority and favour with the Ecclesiarchy even if the financial loss was heavy. The benefits to military organisation were quite helpful however since the advanced tax enabled the Bishop to maintain his own retinues and would require the Crown''s own soldiers to exact the taxes from the people for the Church.',
'Crusade taxation was one of the more extreme taxation systems of the medieval Church, although it was often blamed on the Crown this was only due to the fact that the Church required the king''s soldiers to enforce and exact the taxes from the people. The Crusade taxes were not only current during the Crusades but could be called on at any time, the people themselves were largely unaware of when a crusade was ongoing, and indeed the process of failing and restarting a crusade was quite continual. Of course not all the proceeds went to recruiting and feeding the Crusader armies. Not even all the money reached the Pope, for the most part it only lined the pockets of the local bishops -nonetheless as with all this donated land and power from the Crown to the Church- it gave the king a good deal of religious support that he could weaponise in the secular sector.',
'One of the three types of land ownership in the Swedish Middle Ages was the Crown claiming rights over the territory. Although it seems an obvious benefit, it was expensive for the Crown to take control over a large area, man it with workers and oversee taxation and policing of crop yields. What was far more preferable was selling or renting the land out into ''loan'' districts which gave the name ''län'' to specific territories as these made up the area that could be loaned out to a noble or to the Chruch nobility such as Bishops. The benefit of this was that the Crown would have no need to invest in the land and its governance would be covered by another- such as a lord or Bishop. Naturally the yields from that land would be in the property of the tennant so the Crown lost out there but the standard income was very profitable since it was not effected by bad years of harvest. If the nobles experienced so many bad harvests that they were unable to pay their land rent to the Crown the land became forfiet to the Crown once more, in which case the Crown merely found another tennant and rented it out again. In the case of Crown land kept in Crown control the need for a constant retinue of royal militiamen and bailiffs to enforce the law meant that these districts although a worthy symbol of the king''s personal wealth and power, was a very costly asset. Nonethless the access to pockets of control across the country did have benefits in governance. Records show that on average only 5% of the Swedish realm was made up of Crown Lands.',
'Every Crownland had a royal estate, the king would visit these as regularly as his vassals, they were his direct personal income over which he had total control. Ironically they often had only symbolic value, a king with a great many estates stregically placed across the country was a reminder of the power of the king. However the cost in running these estates as well as the potential danger for loss of profits during bad harvests meant that they were not really anywhere near as solid and steady an income as the smaller tributes from the leased lands.',
'One of the three types of land ownership in the Swedish Middle Ages was granting land to the free farmers or ''bönder'' whose power, authority and wealth cannot be understated. It was they who controlled the Thing and in many ways the entirety of Scandinavia, at least until the Black Death. Skattejord was taxable land, although the ownership was completely in the hands of the freemen, the Crown still had the right to claim a tithe (ten percent) of the crop yields and wealth of the territory from the nobles. The benefit of this was that although the Crown received less income from the territory, it was standardised and regular and the land itself was self-governing which was also cost-effective for the Crown.',
'With free regions the Crown still had feudal rights, amongst these were taking advantage of the allegiance that the lower classes owed the king. The king would travel across his dominions and require house and boarding from his subjects, they would literally lay on a great feast for the king and his retinue, and they would then move on to the next estate. Although this had naturally unfair issues about it, for the King this was in fact a very important strategic process of visiting the local lords and by his presence enforcing taxes and vassalage. It was named literally ''guesting'' since it hosted the king on his visits.',
'A gård was an estate, gärdskatt was literally taxable estates. Differentiating from Skattejord, it was not the entire region that was subjected to the Crown but specific nobles and their wealth. This targetting of private properties was neccessary for the Crown to ensure that nobles were not hoarding wealth or avoiding their allegiance to the king. Naturally, focus on the larger estates meant that taxation was much more efficient and productive than employing several taxcollectors to cover the entire region and only draw in lesser incomes from lowly farmers. Gärdskatt was a very cost effective means of gaining larger incomes quickly.',
'A hörgr (Old Norse, plural hörgar) or hearg (Old English) giving the modern English ''harrow'' was a type of religious altar possibly consisting of a heap of stones, used in Norse paganism. Hörgar are attested in the Poetic Edda; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda; written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, sagas, in the poetry of skalds, the Old English poem Beowulf, and in various place names, often in connection with Germanic deities. Many placenames in Iceland, England and Scandinavia have the word hörgr, hörgur or harrow in them, for example Hörgá and Hörgsdalur in Iceland and Harg in Sweden. When Willibrord christianized the Netherlands (circa 700 AD) the church of Vlaardingen had a dependency in Harago/Hargan, currently named Harga. This indicates that near those places had been religious sites prior to christianisation. We know from a variety of sources that Christian sites were built on the former pagan sites. For instance from Pope Gregory''s letter to Abbot Melltius on Augustine''s conversion campaign in England. "Tell Augustine that he should be no means destroy the temples of the gods but rather the idols within those temples. Let him, after he has purified them with holy water, place altars and relics of the saints in them. For, if those temples are well built, they should be converted from the worship of demons to the service of the true God. Thus, seeing that their places of worship are not destroyed, the people will banish error from their hearts and come to places familiar and dear to them in acknowledgement and worship of the true God."',
'A lund is a simple grove, or clearing in the woods. These sites were typical places of religious importance, since a grove allowed an assembly of people around a fire and clear view of the sky which was naturally an important aspect of the nature religion. All nature was the centrepoint of the religion, and we know from as far back as year 98 AD in the time of the Roman historian Tacitus that groves were sacred to Germanic tribes, for as Tacitus records, ritual washing beforehand and silence whilst within the grove were compulsory and sometimes men were brought in blindfolded and bound so that the location was known only to the priests. Often sacred horses or other animals were associated with the grove and these could neither be hunted nor tamed but were seen as familiars of the gods and the spirit realm.',
'A ''god-hof'' or god-hall was the main temple of Germanic paganism, also known as Asatrú- the belief in the Aesir gods. These wooden constructions were quite large and complex structures, the oldest Scandinavian christian churches that still survive today are clearly based on the pagan temples they replaced. They show a form of architecture that is very similar to the religious architecture of other cultures, especially in the far east where levels of the building represent the different states of consciousness or varying realms of the spirits. The main focus of the building has height, much like a christian steeple in order to symbolise the pillar of the earth and heavens which is a motif that repeats constantly in European pagan art and myth, often in the form of a tree which is related in ideology to the myth of the tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden and in the myths of many other religions throughout the world. The Christian Adam of Bremen writing of the temple at Uppsala circa 1075 wrote "The temple is situated on level ground, surrounded by mountains. A large tree with spreading branches stands near the temple. There is also a spring nearby where the heathens make offerings. A golden chain completely surrounds the temple, and its roof, too, is covered with gold." The chain is thought to symbolise the bands that link the world in a network, this complex knotwork is seen throughout European pagan artwork. In the Nordic myths the two creatures that rise at Ragnarok to destroy the world are kept tied in similar bonds and chains, being Irmingander the World Serpent that makes up the fabric of the world and is ''so large that he is knotted upon himself, his tale in his mouth'', likewise the Fenris Wolf is bound by a sacred chain of divine power as is their father the wicked god Loki who is bound by the snakes and entrails of his children until Doomsday. The golden roof was meant to reflect the light, it is thought to highlight the power and blessing of the sun and moon.',
'An Odens Sal or Odens Hall, was a temple holy to the Allfather god, also known in Old English tradition as Woden, giving us the word Wednesday. The most famous temple associated with Oden in Sweden was the Great High Temple at Uppsala, a place named after the temple or ''sal'' itself. The temple was sacred to all the gods but it is known that every ninth year (a number considered highly symbolic in Asatrú religion) a sacrifice was held to Oden. The only record we ahve of this is highly biassed since it comes not only from a christian source but from the pen of a cleric at the German Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen which claimed ecclesiastic political jurisdiction over the christian Swedish kings, and this report was meant to shame them. Adam of Bremen, who died in about 1085, wrote his ecclesiastical history of the Bishopric of Hamburg between 1072 and 1076, using both oral and written sources he stated that: "Every nine years a great ceremony is held at Uppsala. People bring sacrifices (offerings of food and gifts) from all the Swedish provinces. The most distressing feature of this festival is that Christians too participate in the sacrifices, thus marking their return to heathenism. At this festival animals and humans are sacrificed, and their bodies are hung in the trees of a sacred grove that is adjacent to the temple. The heathens believe that the grove has been made sacred through the death and the putrefaction of the many victims that have hung there. A seventy-two year old Christian reported to me that he had personally witnessed these sacrifices. The heathens chant many different prayers and incantations during these rituals, but they are so vile that I will say nothing further about them." Oden was not only the king of the gods, but the god of kings and the nobility prayed to him for victory in battle as well as for law. We know from other sources that criminals (possibly also the victims at Uppsala) were offered at crossroads, hung and pierced by a spear to Odin. Furthermore Odin was the founder of the runes which was a form of writing and holy scripture and in pagan society was only practiced by priests and the upper class.',

'Most Templars came from aristocratic backgrounds, even the sergentry class were not mere peasants but upper middle class landowners who were trained in combat from birth. When they joined the Order, they turned over a good part of their private wealth to the Order. Even sympathetic lords and laymen made vast donations becoming Donati, often serving with the Order in battle for short periods to ensure their penance was done. What this meant was that the Temple was sitting on vast reserves of land and bullion by the thirteenth century. Their hundreds of thick-walled preceptories were not just places of worship but banks as well. This sprawling network of preceptories across Europe and the Middle East allowed the Order to offer a way for people to become more mobile without fear of losing their wealth. The Templars were founded orginally to guard pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land, only later becoming the ''divine wrath''. The system of investment with the Order grew organically out of this fundamental raison d''etre. Pilgrims, penitents, and crusaders deposited physical wealth and land deeds with the Order to save them from carrying around actual cash. These ''clients'' would then make withdrawals from another preceptory, for instance once they reached the Holy Land, and this was subject to interest. In the common event of the client''s death, the Order acted as clerks and executors of the Will, again taking their own cut for their services. The added bonus of dealing with the preceptories was that you knew you were leaving your money in a heavily guarded place. Interest and capital banking soon became the very fuel that drove the Order, making them welcome tennants to most of Europe not just along the pilgrimage routes. In turn the Templars became so rich as a military organisation that they were effectively the Pope''s personal army of elites. However, investment banking called ''usury'' in the Middle Ages was totally illegal and contrary to Christian law. It was for this reason that Jews were among the few allowed to work as bankers. The Church overlooked the Templar usuries, as it grew slowly out of the pilgrims'' safety deposit system and the Pope quickly saw the effectiveness of this commerce. It was argued that usury was against God''s law but since the Templars were acting for God they were not taking interest for themselves but for Holy purposes and the Crusades. However, the Order by virtue of being the very few legal bankers in Christendom were able to charge extortionate interest rates- much higher than the Jewish bankers- around 60%. This naturally made them very powerful and since they had the ability to physically enforce their forfeits they found that the royal families of Europe were becoming heavily indebted to the Order. This led to political conspiracies, much like the animosity and seizure of assets targetted against the Jews. Eventually, with the abetting of the Pope, the French King was able to frame the entire Order overnight for heresy and all their vast wealth was confiscated and divided up. Many of the Templars were burnt at the stake, some managed to escape to Portugal where they founded a new Order called the Knights of Christ.',

'While the Perfecti pledged themselves to ascetic lives of simplicity, frugality and purity, Cathar credentes (believers) were not expected to adopt the same stringent lifestyle. They were, however, expected to refrain from eating meat and dairy products, from killing and from swearing oaths. Catharism was above all a populist religion and the numbers of those who considered themselves "believers" in the late 12th century included a sizeable portion of the population of Languedoc, counting among them many noble families and courts. These individuals often drank, ate meat, and led relatively normal lives within medieval society—in contrast to the Perfecti, whom they honoured as exemplars. Though unable to embrace the life of chastity, the credentes looked toward an eventual time when this would be their calling and path.',
'Perfect (also known as a Parfait in French or Perfecti in Latin) was the name given to a monk of the medieval French Christian religious movement commonly referred to as the Cathars. They were expected to follow a lifestyle of extreme renunciation and austerity from the world which included abstaining from eating meat and avoiding all sexual contact. By that virtue they were recognized as trans-material (i.e. spiritualized) angels by their followers, the Credentes (Croyant in French, Believers in English). Perfectii were drawn from all walks of life and counted aristocrats, merchants and peasants among their number. Women could also become Perfects; Female Perfects were known as Parfaites or Perfectae.One of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum (Consolation) to the dying - this ensured admittance of the soul of the deceased to heaven and normally required a request from the recipient to a Perfect for the Consolamentum - this meant that many Perfects would not administer the Consolamentum to those who were beyond reason or sentient speech - as they clearly were not in a position to make the necessary request. One of the conditions of being a Credente was the uttering of the Convanenza, or Covenant, when encountering a Perfect, which involved the request for the Consolamentum should they be dying. This was aimed at enabling the Perfect to bestow the sacrament to those whose illness meant they could not ask for it. The Cathars believed in a doctrine of reincarnation interpreting the idea of Eternal Life promised in the Bible as meaning release from the cycle of successive births in this world, which they believed to be ruled over by Satan. The Consolamentum was thought to purify the soul through the Holy Spirit before death to enable its ascent to Christ. Naturally it was this priesthood, so widespread throughout France, the Low Countries and northern Italy as well as the Bogomil homelands of Thrace that were so heavily persecuted by the conventional Churches of Catholicism and Orthodoxy.',
'An individual entered into the community of Perfecti through a ritual known as the consolamentum, a rite that was both sacramental and sacerdotal in nature: sacramental in that it granted redemption and liberation from this world; sacerdotal in that those who had received this rite functioned in some ways as the Cathar clergy—though the idea of priesthood was explicitly rejected. The consolamentum was the baptism of the Holy Spirit, baptismal regeneration, absolution, and ordination all in one. The ritual consisted of the laying on of hands (and the transfer of the spirit) in a manner believed to have been passed down in unbroken succession from Jesus Christ. Upon reception of the consolamentum, the new Perfectus surrendered his or her worldly goods to the community, vested himself in a simple black or blue robe with cord belt, and sought to undertake a life dedicated to following the example of Christ and his Apostles — an often peripatetic life devoted to purity, prayer, preaching and charitable work. Above all, the Perfecti were dedicated to enabling others to find the road that led from the dark land ruled by the dark lord, to the realm of light which they believed to be humankind''s first source and ultimate end.',
'The term Pays Cathare, French meaning "Cathar Country" is used to highlight the Cathar heritage and history of the region where Catharism was traditionally strongest. Only though a modern term it does have some value as a reference to those homelands of Albigensian Catharism which was so successfual and popular not only in creating its own population of believers but being accepted by its neighbours who particularly in the case of the catholic population Toulouse were ready to fight and die -even as Catholics- to protect these men and women who were called Bons Chretiens: ''Good Christians''.',
'Cathar castles (in French Châteaux cathares) is a modern term used to designate a series of fortresses built by the French king on the southern border of his lands at the end of the Albigensian Crusade. Some of these sites, before the royal period, were fortified villages capable of sheltering Cathars and which were destroyed during the building of citadels. In Languedoc, the only real "Cathar castles" were fortified homesteads (castrum), such as Laurac, Fanjeaux, Mas-Saintes-Puelles. Certain sites like Lastours-Cabaret, Montségur, Termes or Puilaurens were castra before being razed to the ground and becoming royal citadels. The legend of Cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth. The only monuments which witnessed the events of the first half of the 13th century, and therefore the only ones which can claim the description "Cathar", given that the Cathar Church never built anything, are the small castles. Therefore the majority of castles given over to the Cathars- inkeeping with their largely pacifist faith were purely defensive structures where the last vestiges of persecuted ''heretics'' fled from the Catholics. Although the loss in territory to this religious minority involved a loss of land, it did in fact stabilise the outlying regions and enable a form local autonomies that would defend themselves independently from Albigensian Crusaders.',
'The Inquisition was established in 1229 to uproot the remaining Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, Carcassonne and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it finally succeeded in extirpating the movement. Cathars who refused to recant were hanged, or burnt at the stake. From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of Montségur was besieged by the troops of the seneschal of Carcassonne and the archbishop of Narbonne. On 16 March 1244, a large and symbolically important massacre took place, where over 200 Cathar perfects were burnt in an enormous fire at the prat des cramats near the foot of the castle. Moreover, the Church decreed lesser chastisements against laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars, at the 1235 Council of Narbonne. Inquisitors required heretical sympathisers - repentant first offenders - to sew a yellow cross onto their clothes. A popular though as yet unsubstantiated theory holds that a small party of Cathar perfects escaped from the fortress before the massacre at prat des cramats. It is widely held in the Cathar region to this day that the escapees took with them Le Tresor Cathar. What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars'' accumulated wealth made up of the sizeable donations of the converted nobility of the area as well as any property of those that became Perfecti. This ''treasure'' whether material or literary was quite arguably the very impetus that continued to drive the survival of Catharism throughout Europe well into the late Middle Ages where they were seen in the riots and persecutions in as far afield as Russia, the Low Countries and Spain.',

'Usury from Medieval Latin usuria, "interest", or from Latin usura, "interest" originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as investment and capital. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. The term is largely derived from Christian religious principles; Riba is the corresponding Arabic term and ribbit is the Hebrew word. The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury (canon 17). At the time, usury was interest of any kind, and the canon merely forbade the clergy to lend money on interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% APR). Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity. The Third Lateran Council decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor Christian burial. Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury a heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation which allowed it. Pope Sixtus V condemned the practice of charging interest as "detestable to God and man, damned by the sacred canons and contrary to Christian charity." All of this however, had absolutely no application to Jews. The Torah makes a distinction between interest deducted before the loan is handed over and interest deducted afterwards. What is clear – as with so much of the Old Testament – is that many prohibitions applied within the Jewish community did not apply outside. In other words, there was a loophole allowing interest to be charged to gentiles. Nonetheless Talmudic Law confined Jewish interest rates to 20%. With the rise of Templar banking and Italian banking who both had comparatively astronomical interest rates (possibly due to the social constrictions which they had found loopholes through) Jewish banking remained extremely popular due to its fairness. As the Jews were ostracized from most professions by local rulers, the church and the guilds, they were pushed into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending. Natural tensions between creditors and debtors were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Precisely in the same way that the aristoricies and European royal families found themselves indebted to the Templars and thereby conspired their demise, so Jews were pushed out of Europe. In 1275, Edward I of England passed the Statute of Jewry which made usury illegal and linked it to blasphemy, in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to the Crown. In 1290, all Jews were expelled from England, and allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown''s. The usury was cited as the official reason for the Edict of Expulsion. The violence targetted at Jews increased in Europe, no doubt encouraged by the indebted aristocracy. In time Italian bankers won the financial war and their way of doing business transformed European commerce, dragging Europe into the Renaissance.',
'The "Constitution for the Jews" was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first bill was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II, intended to protect Jews who suffered during the First Crusade, and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century. The bill forbade, besides other things, Christians from forcing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication. Rather than being specifically targetted at treatment of Jews in Judea, it was more practically focussed on the Jewish communities in Eruope. Jewish merchants and bankers were the lifeblood of European business and ''usury'' or investment banking was reserved solely for Jews. In an attempt to entice more Jews into Europe, with the lure that they were constitutionally protected by religious law- the Pope took this official stance. However as was seen on so many occassions with the terrible violence and blood libels targetted on the Jewish community, this Constitution was in time proven an empty promise.',
'Benedictine refers to the spirituality and consecrated life in accordance with the Rule of St Benedict, written by Benedict of Nursia in the sixth century for the cenobitic communities he founded in central Italy. The most notable of these is Monte Cassino, the first monastery founded by Benedict around 529. Once a postulant has formally entered a monastery he must stay there until he dies. All monks must take turns working in the kitchens and waiting at table. Monks must remain busy, either with manual work, restoring manuscripts or in study and prayer. Monks must remain silent unless they have to speak. The Abbot must be a father to his community. The Abbot must hold meetings with all the monks to decide monastery business. The Abbot''s orders must be obeyed without argument. Every monk must take a vow of chastity. No one should own anything. Monks must pray together seven times a day. At every meal, there must be a reading from the bible. Great care must be taken of those who are sick. The large tracts of land needed to support these communities often meant that the lord who had donated his land to the Order would have to make most use of the rest of his domains by intensifying serfdom and condensing his local population onto smaller patches of land. The poor provincials in the vicinity of the monasteries in any case benefitted from the religous services they performed as wewll as the medical care they offered the communities. The monks also served as clerks and adminstrators for the local landowners and also provided cultural submissions such as art and literature, often focussing on the recording and collection of histories.',
'The word abbot meaning father, is a title given to the head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is Abbess. Monasticism in the West owes its extension and development to Benedict of Nursia (born AD 480). His rule was diffused with miraculous rapidity from the parent foundation on Monte Cassino through the whole of western Europe, and every country witnessed the erection of monasteries far exceeding anything that had yet been seen in spaciousness and splendour. Few great towns in Italy were without their Benedictine convent, and they quickly rose in all the great centres of population in England, France and Spain. The number of these monasteries founded between AD 520 and 700 is amazing. Before the Council of Constance, AD 1415, no fewer than 15,070 abbeys had been established of this order alone. The buildings of a Benedictine abbey were uniformly arranged after one plan, modified where necessary (as at Durham and Worcester, where the monasteries stand close to the steep bank of a river) to accommodate the arrangement to local circumstances. In the high Middle Ages, some abbots even claimed supremacy over bishops an actually took on the mantle of episcopal regalia and insignia. When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop''s diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot''s journey to Rome. ',
'In the heyday of the monastic schools in the 9th and 10th centuries, the teachings of important scholars such as Alcuin, Hrabanus Maurus, Heiric of Auxerre and Notker Balbulus raised the prestige of their abbeys and attracted pupils from afar to attend their courses. Although some monastic schools contributed to the emerging medieval universities, the rise of the universities did not go unchallenged. Some monastic figures such as Bernard of Clairvaux considered the search for knowledge using the techniques of scholasticism to be a challenge to the monastic ideal of simplicity. The rise of medieval universities and scholasticism in the Renaissance of the 12th century offered alternative venues and new learning opportunities to the students and thus led to a gradual decline of the monastic schools.',
'The term Cistercian (French Cistercien), derives from Cistercium, the Latin name for the village of Cîteaux, near Dijon in eastern France. It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded Cîteaux Abbey in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict. The best known of them were Robert of Molesme, Alberic of Citeaux and the English monk Stephen Harding, who were the first three abbots. Bernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order. By the end of the 12th century, the order had spread throughout France and into England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Eastern Europe. The most striking feature of the Order was the return to manual labour, especially field-work, a special characteristic of Cistercian life. Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture. Additionally, in relation to fields such as agriculture, hydraulic engineering and metallurgy, the Cistercians became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. The monasteries despite usually being situated in very inhospitable terrain, were granted better land in time from religious aristocrats. This took land away from the commoners, however their addition to the culture of provincial life and benefits that were arguably worth it.',
'The Mendicant Orders were religious orders which depended directly on the charity of the people for their livelihood. In principle, they rejected owned property, either individually or collectively, believing that this was the most pure way of life to copy followed by Jesus Christ, in order that all their time and energy could be expended on religious work. Since they did not take up massive tracts of farmlands to support themselves they were widely accepted by the local communities they interacted with. They were able to offer medical support and were key members of daily life, officiating birth, marriage and death rites as well as carrying services each week and on all the many Catholic feast days. The Orders included were -Franciscans (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209. Carmelites, (Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206–1214. Dominicans (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215. Servites (Order of Servants of Mary), founded 1233 by the Seven Holy Men of Florence, Italy. Augustinians (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars), founded 1244 - 1256. The Second Council of Lyons (1274) recognized these as the five "great" mendicant orders, and suppressed certain others. The Council of Trent loosened their property restrictions. Afterwards, except for the Franciscans and their offshoot the Capuchins, members of the orders were permitted to own property collectively as do monks. Among other orders are the Trinitarians (Order of the Most Blessed Trinity), founded 1193. Mercedarians (Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy), founded 1218. Minims (Hermits of St. Francis of Paola), founded 1436',

'A Hansa Kontor, was simply an administrative office for the clerks, merchants and officers of trade to conduct business. The sheer organisational abilities of the Hansa meant that such an office in a foreign port was a powerful –and wealthy- force. In many ways a Kontor could spread through a city making a small city district and naturally begun to upset the local merchants because they aggressively outsourced them.',
'A Hansa city was an official recognition, usually by the Imperial forces that had now come to use the Hansa as a colonising force. The establishment of a Hansa City brought with it extensive security measures to ensure safe passage of shipping and trade over land as well. It allowed trade to be conducted in a much more organised manner which in turn was much more efficient at harvesting tax revenue for the local lords and the king.',
'The trade between the merchant associations of Hamburg and Luebeck provided a model for the merchant associations of the other North German cities to follow. In 1201 Cologne, already wealthy, joined the league. Danzig, whose port was a gateway to the eastern Baltic also joined as did most of the important Baltic port cities. By the height of the Hansa''s power merchants from over sixty cities had joined the association. While each city had its own merchant association the alliance formed a loose Diet, or parliament, to govern inter-city trade and common policies. In most respects the policy of the merchants was protectionist and aimed at producing a German monopoly in the markets they supplied. The Hanseatic Diet met only infrequently and was filled with divisive politics based on differences in regional priorities. It was more frequent that the regional assemblies, known as "thirds", met. There was a Rhennish third based on the Rhine trade, a Wendish third based on Baltic shipping out of Luebeck, and a Prussian third based on the trade of grain from the lands of the Teutonic Order. The predominant town in all dealings was Luebeck, which held a central position at the Baltic side of the Danish Sound. Other member cities often complained that the merchants from Luebeck were given advantages over their own merchants. While most of the cities in the Hansa were within the domains of local feudal lords and the citizens of these cities were feudal vassals Luebeck was one of the few "free cities" or more properly, it was an imperial city which owed its allegiance to the emperor alone. This in itself gave Luebeck an advantage over many of the other cities. When added to that are the position it held geographically and the access it had to the rich herring fisheries its predominant position in the alliance is understandable. Almost all trade to the Baltic, either coming or going, went through the port of Luebeck.',
'Lit. ‘Senate of the Kingdom’ this self-referential term was used in the Danish law documents of the Constitutio Valdemariana, or Constitutions of King Valdemar circa 1326. The Constitution was signed in the Duchy of Southern Jutland on the borders with the Holy Roman Empire. “Item ducatus Sunder-Jucie regno et corone Dacie non unictur nee annectetur, ita quod unus sit dominus utriusque etc.” refers to the stipulation that the Duchy would always give allegiance to Denmark and accept the dominance of the Crown as long as the seat was not held by the same man (Duke and King). It was in fact this factor that eventually led to the break of Denmark-Norway from the Kalmar Union under Christian I. How the Senatus Regnum itself was relevant to the rise of powers in Scandinavia was the strength of the Riksråd, royal council and deep-rooted establishment of the parliament and constitutional powers. The Latin gloss for Riksråd was itself symbolic of a greater more worldly sense of a true medieval Empire that was beginning to form in the north of Europe.',
'The Coronation Brief, was a document signed in Kalmar itself and was the first major accession of the three kingdoms, although the brief did not stipulate any specific powers "oc han gøre widh oss alle som hanom bør at gøre" (and he shall do with us all that he should do”) to the king in question (ruling as Erik I of Sweden, Erik III of Norway and Erik VII of Denmark).',
'The ’Brief of Union’ or document of union stipulated the conditions for the formal association of the three Nordic kingdoms under one collective crown. “Allæ thisse thry rike Danmarc, Suerike oc Norghe met en ræt endrecht oc sæmyæ oc kerlich oc gothwilghæ huars rikesens om sich oc met radh oc fullbordh oc samthykke høghbørne førstynne.” This was the major constitution of the of the earlier attempts made to unify the three kingdoms after accepting the candidate Erik af Pommern, who was the chosen adoptive heir of the powerful Queen Margareta Valdemarsdotter, the true force behind the Kalmar Union.'

'The word ''limes'' was utilized by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier. The "Roman Limes" represented the border line of the Roman Empire at its greatest extent in the 2nd century AD. It stretched over 5,000 km from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The remains of the Limes today consist of vestiges of built walls, ditches, forts, fortresses, and civilian settlements.',
'Civitas Finitima was a fontier settlement. These regional capitals were considered fairly dangerous places since enemies, either military, political, cultural or economic were beyond the very close boundary of the ''empire'' or faction. Nonethless it was exactly for this reason that populations quickly swelled into these areas where trade and commerce was seen as a worthwhile endeavour and poorer people or those wishing to escape oppression and indentured service in the homelands could establish new lands and farmsteads in the colonies- typically using the old population as serfs or slaves.',
'To accept a province as a vassal, was to recognise its status as part of the realm and usually given to a specific governor. Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus "servant", a term used as part of feudalism in medieval Europe, where one enters into mutual obligations to a monarch, usually in the form of military support and mutual protection, in exchange for certain privileges, usually to include land held as a fiefdom. This system can be applied to similar systems in other feudal societies.',
'A commendation ceremony (commendatio) is a formal ceremony that evolved during the Early Medieval period to create a bond between a lord and his fighting man, called his vassal (Latin vassus). The first recorded ceremony of commendatio was in 7th century France, but the relationship of vassalage was older, and predated even the medieval formulations of a noble class. The lord''s "servant" (vassus) might be born unfree, but the commendatio freed him. When two men entered into a feudal relationship, they underwent a ceremony known as commendation ceremony. The purpose of the commendation was to make a chosen person a vassal of a lord.',
'The fief (alternatively, fee, feoff, fiefdom) or feudum (in Latin), under the system of medieval European feudalism, often consisted of inheritable lands or revenue-producing property granted by a lord to a vassal who held seisin in return for a form of allegiance (usually given by homage and fealty). Not only land but anything of value could be held in fief, such as an office, a right of exploitation (e.g., hunting, fishing) or any other type of revenue, rather than the land it comes from.',

'The curia was the King''s court, composed of those advisers and courtiers who followed the King as he travelled around the country. This was not a dedicated court of law, instead a descendant of the Old English ''witenagemot''. In concert with the curia regis, eyre circuits staffed by itinerant judges dispensed justice throughout the country, operating on fixed paths at certain times.',
'The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a court that followed equity, a set of legal principles based on natural law, and common law, in England and Wales. Originally part of the curia regis, or King''s Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the curia during the 1190s, sitting as an independent, central court. The court was initially small, handling around 250 cases a year compared to 2,500 in the later Court of King''s Bench and 10,000 in the Court of Common Pleas.',
'One of the two main administrative offices, along with the Exchequer. It began as part of the royal household -curia regis, but by the 13th-century was separate from the household and was located at Westminster. It produced all the charters and writs, which were all sealed with the Great Seal. The office was headed by the Chancellor of England, and was staffed by royal clerks. It came into existence shortly before the Norman Conquest of England, and was retained by King William I of England after the Conquest.',
'Under the feudal system that evolved in England following the Norman invasion of 1066, the laws of the Crown could not have been upheld without the support of the nobility and the clergy. The former had economic and military power bases of their own through major ownership of land and the feudal obligations of their tenants (some of whom held lands on condition of military service). The Church - then still part of the Roman Catholic Church and so owing ultimate loyalty to Rome - was virtually a law unto itself in this period as it had its own system of religious law courts. In order to seek consultation and consent from the nobility and the senior clergy on major decisions, post-1066 English monarchs called Great Councils. A typical Great Council would consist of archbishops, bishops, abbots, barons and earls, the pillars of the feudal system.',
'The Palace of Westminster site was strategically important during the Middle Ages, as it was located on the banks of the River Thames. Known in medieval times as Thorney Island, the site may have been first-used for a royal residence by Canute the Great during his reign from 1016 to 1035. St Edward the Confessor, the penultimate Saxon monarch of England, built a royal palace on Thorney Island just west of the City of London at about the same time as he built Westminster Abbey (1045–50). Thorney Island and the surrounding area soon became known as Westminster (a contraction of the words West Minster). Neither the buildings used by the Saxons nor those used by William I survive.',
'The court took its name from the "Star Chamber" or "Starred Chamber" which was built in the reign of King Edward II specifically for the meetings of the King''s Council, though the origins of the name of the room itself are unclear. The first reference to the chamber is in 1398, as the Sterred chambre; the more common form of the name appears in 1422 as le Sterne-chamere. Both forms recur throughout the fifteenth century, with Sterred Chambre last attested as appearing in the Supremacy of the Crown Act 1534. Initially well regarded because of its speed and flexibility, it was made up of Privy Counsellors, as well as common-law judges, and supplemented the activities of the common-law and equity courts in both civil and criminal matters.',
'Court of the King Before the King Himself, also called Coram rege de banco with which it overlapped with the later Court of Common Pleas was an English court of common law in the English legal system. Created from the curia regis, it initially following the monarch on his travels, the King''s Bench finally joined the Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas in Westminster Hall in 1318, making its last travels in 1421. As one of the two principal common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King''s Bench''s jurisdiction and caseload was significant.',
'The Court of Common Pleas did not come into existence until the signing of the Magna Carta, which mandated in Section 17 that common pleas (cases between subject and subject, as opposed to cases involving the king) be heard in "some fixed place". Rather than the Common Pleas being created out of the curia regis directly, it instead arose out of the Exchequer of Pleas, another body split from the curia regis.',
'It was originally claimed that the Exchequer was based on a similar Norman court; however, while there are many records of the Exchequer''s work in England, there is no evidence of a similar body in pre-Conquest Normandy. The first concrete records come from the time of Henry I, when the sole surviving Pipe Roll from his reign shows the Exchequer working out of the King''s palace as part of the curia regis. The curia regis followed the king as he went rather than sitting at any one fixed location, and was held in York, London and Northampton at various times.',
'Trinoda necessitas is a Latin term used to refer to a "threefold tax" in pre-Conquest times. Subjects of an Anglo-Saxon king were required to yield three services: bridge-bote (repairing bridges and roads), burgh-bote (building and maintaining fortifications), and fyrd-bote (serving in the militia, known as the fyrd). Rulers very rarely exempted subjects from the trinoda necessitas, because these services were the lifeblood of the English kingdom.',
'Often used to signify the Terrae Normannorum (Norman Lands) or those territories which came under Norman Law (in England, Wales, Ireland and France) following the successive expansion of the Duchy of Normandy following the Conquest. Specifically, in feudal law, Nulle terre sans seigneur is the principle that one provides services to the sovereign (usually serving in his army) for the right to receive land from the sovereign.',
'Primer Seisin (primary lordship) is a French term used originally by the Normans having inherited the system from France, it ascerted the legal possession of a feudal fiefdom by the king in default on legal matters. In feudal England, "escheat" (from Latin excadere) referred to the situation where the tenant of a fief died without an heir, or had committed a felony. The fief reverted to the King''s ownership for one year and one day, by right of primer seisin, after which it reverted to the original lord who had granted it.',
'Distraint or distress (from the Latin districtio) was the seizure of someone’s property in order to obtain payment of rent or other money owed. An act or process whereby a person (the distrainor), traditionally even without prior court approval, seizes the personal property of another located upon the distrainor''s land in satisfaction of a claim, as a pledge for performance of a duty, or in reparation of an injury. Distraint typically involved the seizure of goods (chattels) belonging to the tenant by the landlord to sell the goods for the payment of the rent.',
'The Statute of Gloucester is one of the most important pieces of legislation enacted in the Parliament of England during the reign of Edward I. The Statute, proclaimed at Gloucester in August 1278, was crucial to the development of English law. The Statute of Gloucester, and the ensuing legal hearings, were a means by which Edward I tried to recover regal authority that had been alienated during the reign of his father, King Henry III (1216-1272) who had been made a virtual tool of the baronial party led by Simon de Montfort. Edward I recognized the need for the legal “reform,” and considered the Parliament as a means of buying popular support by encouraging loyal subjects to petition the King against his own barons and ministers.',
'Since the Church never died, the land never left the "dead hand" ("Mortmain" or Church). An alternative explanation of "mortmain" was that an owner from generations earlier was still dictating land use years after death, by leaving it to the Church. Hence the term "dead hand." Before the Statute of Mortmain, large amounts of land were bequethed to the Church, which never relinquished it. This was in contradistinction to normal lands which could be inherited in a family line or revert to a lord or the Crown upon death of the tenant.',
'De donis conditionalibus is the chapter of the English Statutes of Westminster (1285) which originated the law of "Entail". Since the passing of the statute an estate given to a man and the heirs of his body has been known as an ''estate tail'', or an ''estate in fee tail'' (feudum talliatum), the word tail being derived from the French tailler, to cut, the inheritance being by the statute cut down and confined to the heirs of the body.',
'As a result of the Norman Conquest some French religious orders held substantial property through their daughter monasteries in England. Some of these were merely agricultural estates with a single foreign monk in residence to supervise things, others were rich foundations in their own right (e.g. Lewes Priory which was a daughter of Cluny and answered to the abbot of that great French house). Owing to the fairly constant state of war between England and France in the Late Middle Ages successive English governments had objected to money going overseas to France from these Alien Priories (''trading with the enemy'') whence the French king might get hold of it, and to foreign prelates having jurisdiction over English monasteries.',
'Bastard feudalism is a term that has been used to describe feudalism in the Late Middle Ages of England. Its main characteristic is military, political, legal, or domestic service in return for money, office, and/or authority. The gentry began to think of themselves as the men of their lord rather than of the king. A shift in English history took place under Edward I when the feudal levy was replaced with royal payment in return for military service by the great magnates who willingly served the king. Thus, instead of vassals rendering military service when required by the lord, they paid a portion of their income into the lord''s treasury. In turn the lord would supplement the owed military service with hired retainers, a sort of private army in full time service to the lord.',

'Feudal household, the lord''s core military power allowing him to deploy his kinsfolk and extended manservants and their retinues. The establishment of a Maisnade was often a prolonged procedure whereby newly appointed titles and new domains issued from the King or other great masters such as the counts, required time to become accepted into the aristocracy. This ''new blood'' would need to assert its authority and usually marry into other noble houses to affirm its legitimacy. From these maisnade would arise the barons and knights of the county.',
'The core centre of a lord''s military control, usually the direct area which his castle could dominate, or within a day''s ride of his castle. The more strongholds he held in the vicinity of each other, the more readily his troops could move from one stronghold to the next keeping total control over the district or districts in his grasp. The châtelain was originally, in Carolingian times, an official of the count; with the development of feudalism the office became a fief, and so ultimately hereditary. In this as in other respects the châtelain was the equivalent of the viscount; sometimes the two titles were combined, but more usually in those provinces where there were châtelains there were no viscounts, and vice versa.',
'The administrative network of baillages was established in the 13th century, based on the earlier medieval fiscal and tax divisions (the ''baillie'') which had been used by earlier sovereign princes. A bailli was the king’s administrative representative during the ancien régime in northern France, where the bailli was responsible for the application of justice and control of the administration and local finances in his baillage. In southern France, the term generally used was sénéchal who held office in the sénéchaussée.',
'The Marches were usually the domains of barons within a County or Duchy. The regional French masters such as those of Toulouse, Orleans and Blois were all dependent on their lesser vassals- the knights and barons to defend the local territories from rebels and from rival Counts as well as foreign invaders, at least in the initial stages. This feudal service centred predominantly around the ''bailliage et gardia'', and the garrisons of castles.',
'This was the call to arms for the locals, forming garrisons, militias and if needed levies to garrison strongholds. This enabled the lord''s household troops to move move freely on active and aggressive manoevres such as ost (foreign campaigns) and chevauchée (attacks, ambushes and raids) whilst lighter troops kept control of the district from the strongholds.',
'A military-judicial region, usually under the Royal Demesne but could exist in vassal counties too. These were governed by officials who worked parallel to the civil administrators in the towns and were repsonsible for maintaining a body for the standing or levied army. These reserves would include men from the local gentries such as sergeants and knights as well as men drawn from the local militias. The Prévôté maximised the military potential of the region being able to provide constant checks and logistic support on the manpower available, this allowed the region to maintain a full battle-readiness which greatly added to the defensive strength of the faction''s control. For instance, nine towns of the Massif region provided over 3000 sergeants during 1253 when needed, thanks to the Prévôté.',
'A system of mutual help between great knights, counts and lords. Rather than serving as vassals to one another, later communes felt the need to abandon the expensive ammassing of large standing armies and garrisons in favour of maintaining small professional troops and mercenaries. These would rally to each other''s protection during a crisis, pooling their collective resources. The system was far more cost-efficient but had obvious drawbacks to security and was often used to full effect in conspiracies and political betrayals.',
'This law declared that if the King of France found the realm in danger from his enemies, all his subjects were to come to his aid as quickly as they could. If they failed to do so, they were considered guilty of "dereliction of duty...since no one must fail the ruler in such a great matter." In reality, the Princeps namque transcended feudal ties, making army service and support the business of the realm at large.',
'Suzerainty occurs where a region or people is a tributary to a more powerful entity which controls its foreign affairs while allowing the tributary vassal state some limited domestic autonomy. The dominant entity in the suzerainty relationship, or the more powerful entity itself, is called a suzerain. The late Middle French ''sousserain estaige'' was a military summons of the realm by the Dauphin. It enabled him to quickly gather large forces in the event of a mass invasion, or military crisis such as during the 100 Years War',

'Islands off Greenland were sighted by Gunnbjörn Ulfsson when he was blown off course while sailing from Norway to Iceland, probably in the early 10th century. During the 980s, explorers from Iceland and Norway arrived at mainland Greenland and, finding the land unpopulated, settled on the southwest coast.',
'The name Brattahlid means "the steep slope" and it was one of the major villages on Greenland. Erik and his descendants lived there until late in the 15th century.',
'At Brattahlíð stood the first church in the New World: Þjóðhildarkirkja Thjodhild''s church, actually a small chapel. It was the oldest Church of the Greenland colony. Erik the Red himself did not profess Christianity, but his wife, Þjóðhildur who owned the church clearly was. The churchyard has tombstones, with a cross cut only on one of them. On another stand engraved the runes for "Ingibjørg''s Grave". The remains infer that despite being a clearly Christian centre, paganism and the Old Ways were very well-entrenched throughout Greenland''s history.',
'The Western Settlement (Old Norse: Vestribyggð) was the smaller of the two main areas of Greenland settled in around 985 AD by Norse farmers from Iceland (the other settlement being the Eastern Settlement). Much less is known about the Western settlement than the Eastern settlement, very little mention in the written sources and no direct descriptions in any of the medieval sources on Greenland. The Norse settlement is last mentioned in the mid-14th century, when a traveller from the Eastern Settlement found only vacant, abandoned farms it is thought this was due to the stavation and extreme cold suddenly fallen on Northern Europe during the Little Ice Age.',
'The Eastern Settlement (Old Norse: Eystribygð, Icelandic: Eystribyggð) was the largest and first of the three areas of Greenland, settled in approximately 985 AD by Norse farmers from Iceland (the other settlements being the Western and Middle Settlements). At its peak it contained approximately 4,000 inhabitants. The last written record from the Eastern Settlement is of a wedding in 1408; thus it ceased to be occupied after around 1410-1420 AD, about 60–70 years longer than the Western Settlement.',
'Hvalsey was the largest settlement in Greenland, it was the site of the Royal Estate and the largest church of the entire colony.',
'Hvalsey Church (Danish: Hvalsø Kirke) was situated in the fjord of Hvalsey, not far from the largest town in the south of Greenland',
'According to the Icelandic Book of Settlements (Landnámabok), the farmstead was established by Erik the Red''s uncle, Þorkell Farserkur in the late 10th century. The farmstead was originally named Þjóðhildarstaðir. In the 14th century, it belonged to the Kings of Norway: "Næst Einarsfirði liggr Hvalseyjarfjörðr. Þar er kirkja, sem heitir Hvalseyjarfjarðarkirkja.',
'In the sagas it is told that Sokki Þórisson, a wealthy farmer of the Brattahlíð area launched the idea of a separate bishop for Greenland in the early 12th century. He got the approval of the Norwegian King. Most of the clergy would come from Norway. The first bishop of Garðar, Arnaldur, was ordained by the Archbishop of Lund in 1124. He arrived in Greenland in 1126. In the same year he started with the construction of the cathedral, devoted to St. Nicholas, patron saint of sailors. The diocese was first assigned to the Archbishopric of Bremen. The diocese of Garðar was subject to the Archbishop of Lund from 1126-1152. In 1152 the diocese of Greenland, as well as those of Iceland, the Isle of Man, the Orkney Islands, the Faroer Islands became subject to the newly-established Archdiocese of Nidaros.',

'Medieval Swedish farming administration was highly advanced and it allowed a very productive system of agriculture and taxation until the Black Death when many of the villages and farming areas were left totally unpopulated and the landscape reverted to wilderness. During the 1100s, perhaps due to the centralisation of the kingdom, various means of partition and evaluation of the land was made. Most prominent of these was the Marklandsvärderingen which was generally based only in Svealand but had similar systems in Götaland such as Attungen.',
'One of the three types of land ownership in the Swedish Middle Ages was granting land to the Church. When the Church governed a district it took the claim of the Crown''s taxes from that land. All land in the kingdom was taxable by the Crown for at least 10% of its worth and annual harvests, it was only the donated land to the Church which for religious reasons could not be taxed. This was the standard practice for most of the known world in fact. In Sweden, Churchland had a very powerful effect on the local economy however since taxation was ironically much more stringent than in other districts- but this was tax only recieved by the Church and not one penny reached the Crown.',
'Petter was St Peter, or the Papacy, Petterpenning was the act of submitting ''pennies to St Peter'' -it was an extended Church tax that was rather harsh on the local community but did give the Crown more authority and favour with the Ecclesiarchy even if the financial loss was heavy. The benefits to military organisation were quite helpful however since the advanced tax enabled the Bishop to maintain his own retinues and would require the Crown''s own soldiers to exact the taxes from the people for the Church.',
'Crusade taxation was one of the more extreme taxation systems of the medieval Church, although it was often blamed on the Crown this was only due to the fact that the Church required the king''s soldiers to enforce and exact the taxes from the people. The Crusade taxes were not only current during the Crusades but could be called on at any time, the people themselves were largely unaware of when a crusade was ongoing, and indeed the process of failing and restarting a crusade was quite continual. Of course not all the proceeds went to recruiting and feeding the Crusader armies. Not even all the money reached the Pope, for the most part it only lined the pockets of the local bishops -nonetheless as with all this donated land and power from the Crown to the Church- it gave the king a good deal of religious support that he could weaponise in the secular sector.',
'One of the three types of land ownership in the Swedish Middle Ages was the Crown claiming rights over the territory. Although it seems an obvious benefit, it was expensive for the Crown to take control over a large area, man it with workers and oversee taxation and policing of crop yields. What was far more preferable was selling or renting the land out into ''loan'' districts which gave the name ''län'' to specific territories as these made up the area that could be loaned out to a noble or to the Chruch nobility such as Bishops. The benefit of this was that the Crown would have no need to invest in the land and its governance would be covered by another- such as a lord or Bishop.',
'Every Crownland had a royal estate, the king would visit these as regularly as his vassals, they were his direct personal income over which he had total control. Ironically they often had only symbolic value, a king with a great many estates stregically placed across the country was a reminder of the power of the king. However the cost in running these estates as well as the potential danger for loss of profits during bad harvests meant that they were not really anywhere near as solid and steady an income as the smaller tributes from the leased lands.',
'One of the three types of land ownership in the Swedish Middle Ages was granting land to the free farmers or ''bönder'' whose power, authority and wealth cannot be understated. It was they who controlled the Thing and in many ways the entirety of Scandinavia, at least until the Black Death. Skattejord was taxable land, although the ownership was completely in the hands of the freemen, the Crown still had the right to claim a tithe (ten procent) of the crop yields and wealth of the territory from the nobles. The benefit of this was that although the Crown received less income from the territory, it was standardised and regular and the land itself was self-governing which was also cost-effective for the Crown.',
'With free regions the Crown still had feudal rights, amongst these were taking advantage of the allegiance that the lower classes owed the king. The king would travel across his dominions and require house and boarding from his subjects, they would literally lay on a great feast for the king and his retinue, and they would then move on to the next estate. Although this had naturally unfair issues about it, for the King this was in fact a very important strategic process of visiting the local lords and by his presence enforcing taxes and vassalage. It was named literally ''guesting'' since it hosted the king on his visits.',
'A gård was an estate, gärdskatt was literally taxable estates. Differentiating from Skattejord, it was not the entire region that was subjected to the Crown but specific nobles and their wealth. This targetting of private properties was neccessary for the Crown to ensure that nobles were not hoarding wealth or avoiding their allegiance to the king. Naturally, focus on the larger estates meant that taxation was much more efficient and productive than employing several taxcollectors to cover the entire region and only draw in lesser incomes from lowly farmers. Gärdskatt was a very cost effective means of gaining larger incomes quickly.',
'A hörgr (Old Norse, plural hörgar) or hearg (Old English) giving the modern English ''harrow'' was a type of religious altar possibly consisting of a heap of stones, used in Norse paganism.',
'A lund is a simple grove, or clearing in the woods. These sites were typical places of religious importance, since a grove allowed an assembly of people around a fire and clear view of the sky which was naturally an important aspect of the nature religion.',
'A ''god-hof'' or god-hall was the main temple of Germanic paganism, also known as Asatrú- the belief in the Aesir gods.',
'An Odens Sal or Odens Hall, was a temple holy to the Allfather god, also known in Old English tradition as Woden, giving us the word Wednesday.',

'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',
'The sheer size of these magnificent defences is enough to awe the peasants who work in their shadow! These walls are extremely costly, but that price guarantees security against all but the most well-prepared besieging force. Thanks to strong towers, battlements and gatehouses, the defenders can make any assault a chancy business.',

'A Port brings trade to a settlement. Indeed, moving goods by water is the only way to carry large cargoes long distances cheaply and thus turn a profit. The need to keep merchant ships in good order also means that the necessary skills to make military vessels can be found here.',
'A Shipwright has the slipway, wood seasoning stores and manpower needed to build ships for a strong fleet. The improved port buildings - and simple improvements like creating permanent wharves along a waterfront - allow more trade to occur.',
'A Dockyard allows the construction of larger ships, and the improved wharves make trade easier to manage. Goods from all over the world pass through the docks, bringing wealth and excitement into the lives of citizens.',
'A Naval Dockyard allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the port to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',
'Huge port',
'Construction of the Arsenal began around 1104. The Arsenal was actually an entire complex of state-owned shipyards and armories clustered together in Venice harbour. It was the hub of the city''s naval power. It could also be described as the first mass production factory using standardized and interchangeable parts. It was the largest industrial complex in Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution, spanning an area of about 45 ha (110 acres), or about fifteen percent of Venice. Surrounded by a 2 mi (3.2 km) rampart, laborers and shipbuilders regularly worked within the Arsenal, building ships that sailed from the city''s port. With high walls shielding the Arsenal from public view and guards protecting its perimeter, different areas of the Arsenal each produced a particular prefabricated ship part or other maritime implement, such as munitions, rope, and rigging. These parts could then be assembled into a ship in as little as one day. An exclusive forest owned by the Arsenal navy, in the Montello hills area of Veneto, provided the Arsenal''s wood supply. The staff of the Arsenal also developed new firearms at an early date, beginning with bombards in the 1370s and numerous small arms for use against the Genoese a few years later. The muzzle velocity of handguns was improved beyond that of the crossbow, creating armor-piercing rounds. Arsenal-produced arms were also noteworthy for their multi-purpose utility; the Venetian condottieri leader, Bartolomeo Colleoni, is usually given credit as being the first to mount the Arsenal''s new lighter-weight artillery on mobile carriages for field use.',
'The Arsenale Nuovo was built in 1320, much larger than the original Aresenale, it enabled all the state''s navy and the larger merchant ships to be both constructed and maintained in one place. The Arsenal by consequence became an important center for rope manufacture, and housing for the arsenal workers grew up outside its walls. The Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly-built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis.',

'As the need to move increasing quantities of goods and people throughout a region grows, so too grows the call for proper roads. While there are paths to most every populated place in the known world, when the local ruling class invests in clearing debris and packing the earth to produce lasting Dirt Roads, the benefits in increased troop movement and trade soon become obvious.',

'Land Clearance is the first step on the road to establishing organised farming in the countryside, and ensuring that a region will begin to grow and prosper. Though there is little more to land clearance than deforestation and basic tilling of the soil, any area where the local establishment has not taken such measures to make the land workable will struggle to feed its populace.',
'Communal Farming is the natural progression from land clearance, where the farming communities adopt a system of centralised management. By sharing common resources and transportation, communal farming sees all the individual farms in the community achieve a level of productivity, prosperity and security that would otherwise be unattainable.',
'Crop Rotation is a more advanced farming system that maximises the use of farming districts all year round. Going to the trouble of planting different crops in different seasons not only ensures that something is always growing, varying the produce actually improves the soil quality markedly so as to reap greater harvests all year round.',
'Irrigation represents the final frontier in terms of actively improving farming districts. Water is diverted to crops via a system of man-made channels dug into the earth so as to dramatically improve soil fertility. Although irrigating the land is grand and arduous task, and maintaining proper irrigation is an ongoing job, the benefits from the resulting surplus of food produced make the endeavour well worth it.',

'The Town Watch are a combination of militia, thief-takers, linkboys, and patrolmen. Having a small barrack-house gives them somewhere to train and store their weapons and is a useful first step in creating a local military culture and keeping public order.\nThis building is controlled by the ruling noble and not the King, so it is uneffected by the King''s Authority. Though this provides benefits to happiness it reduces trade since the ruling noble keeps more money for themself.',
'A Town Guard barracks is often a mark of prosperity as the locals show some civic pride by looking to their own defences. Here the young men of a town can be given basic training in the use of arms, taught to obey a few simple orders, and given some sense of military worth.\nThis building is controlled by the ruling noble and not the King, so it is uneffected by the King''s Authority. Though this provides benefits to happiness it reduces trade since the ruling noble keeps more money for themself.',
'The City Watch barracks is a centre for pursuits worthy of true soldiers, a place for exercises, drill and weapons practice. Those who would style themselves gentlemen can train here without loss of social status. The lower citizens can be taught the rudiments of drill too, and given better weapons from the attached armoury.\nThis building is controlled by the ruling noble and not the King, so it is uneffected by the King''s Authority. Though this provides benefits to happiness it reduces trade since the ruling noble keeps more money for themself.',
'Men need drill to learn the discipline of combat because skill at arms is only half the story. Moving as one in battle means mutual support, and standing shoulder to shoulder with a comrade gives many men the courage to go forward. Drill is a practical matter too: it takes practice not to tangle up pikes, spears and the like when moving en masse.\nThis building is controlled by the ruling noble and not the King, so it is uneffected by the King''s Authority. Though this provides benefits to happiness it reduces trade since the ruling noble keeps more money for themself.',

'National armies were gathered for campaigns in a specific office usually attached to weapon stores. Men from all over the province would assemble and usually have their names taken down and documented in a roll either individually or under a unit officer/sergeant. Often a man would be banded into local groups, arriving with his family or neighbours and they would be documented for pay as a group in this respect. Once the names were taken, terms of service and pay established and the men organised into fighting bodies or companies the army would then mobilise from this centre.',
'Standing armies of the professional (above militia level) were quite rare or fairly small and localised. Nobles and guard retinues to lords or kings were a development based on central authority, continued warfare, the need for internal state security and the organisation to exact taxation. Extended retinues could form a core ''army'' around a duke, bishop or king and would generally be continually deployed to earn their keep, usually in one of the roles mentioned above. At ''home'' they would live, eat, sleep and train together where their loyalty could be properly overseen and their ability to be quickly mobilised enhanced.',
'As campaigns became more regular, the need for proper organisation of units from the noble to levy levels was seen as a sensible way of maintaining order in battle and cohesion for tactics and strategical surety. Fields and flat areas such as marshlands were often used for military drills. FitzStephen in the time of King Henry III describes the militias and standing army training together iin the area of Aldgate, making reference to the military exercises conducted annually, as well as other sports with a military bent, such as tournament-type activities on the Thames or the frozen marshes, javelin throwing, and hand-to-hand combat. In his opening paragraph, he praises in the same breath the commercial success of the townsmen and their physical prowess, while at the same time boasting of the strength of its fortifications. His estimate of London forces comprised 60,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry.',
'Usually seen as a post-medieval concept, regiments (related to the word ''regime''- rule or organisation) was merely the term applied to constitutions of companies or societas armorum assembled into a larger body. Typically formed around the provincial capital, or capital of the realm these armies would be relatively small in number during peactime but comprised the royal administrative officers and the masters-at-arms, standard-bearers, squires and a large host of logistical staff who could not be disbanded due to the needs of military efficiency. These were usually all under control of the monarch and/or the Marshall of the Realm. When nobles and levies were called up into service it would be this core ''headquarters'' that would be responsible for overseeing pay, terms of service, organisation and the enforcement of marshall law.',
'With the event of more serious attempts to create professional armies, particularly thanks to drawn-out campaigns such as the 100 Years War or the constant local fighting in Italy or Spain, the need to apply tactics and strategy beyond the previously accepted social boundaries of piety was required. Hardly comparable to schools or colleges, these ''academia'' were generally speaking no more than an idea imposed over the earlier military structure. The royal and national retinues would propogate specific organisational ideas and the doctrines of the ''science of war''. With the rise of the crossbow, longbow, gunpowder and sieging methods which neutralised the ''panzers'' of piety in the form of the knights, cost effective forces could be now maintained and kept on constant stand-by or actual deployment in campaigns.',
'In the 1300s warfare on the large scale had developed scientifically in great bounds. In the small scale it was also nurtured in Europe into martial arts, where the focus on nobles and their horsemanship was thrown out of the window. Although to be fair, some ''masters'' attempted to transfer and apply many of the old concepts to the continuing tradition the fact was that any man with a sword (pretty much the majority of the male population) could be taught to fight using martial arts. Masters such as the German Johannes Lecküchner, Hans von Speyer, Peter Falkner, Paulus Kal and Hans Folz all developed advanced (and most importantly documented) schools of fighting using various weapons such as polearms, heavy swords, and light swords with bucklers, even the use of the dagger- traditionally used by lower ranks for killing unhorsed knights using the long blade to delve between the armour. Italian schools were also prominent: in the words of the Pisan Fillipo Vadi "It is good to measure blows and steps, To find your trust in science, Fencing is born from geometry."',
'The word ''limes'' was utilized by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier. The "Roman Limes" represented the border line of the Roman Empire at its greatest extent in the 2nd century AD. It stretched over 5,000 km from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The remains of the Limes today consist of vestiges of built walls, ditches, forts, fortresses, and civilian settlements. The word ''limes'' gave rise to the English ''limits'' and other European equivalents, ''city limits'' were a similar concept to the colonial ''limes'' of an empire, either Roman of medieval. The Limes Saxoniae (Latin for "Limit of Saxony"), also known as the Limes Saxonicus or Sachsenwall ("Saxon Wall"), was a limes or border between the Saxons and the Slavic Obotrites, established about 810 in present-day Schleswig-Holstein. After Charlemagne had finally conquered the Saxon lands, he signed the 811 Treaty of Heiligen with the neighbouring Danes and may at the same time have reached a border agreement with the Polabian Slavs in the east. As no major fortifications existed, the Limes mainly followed natural obstacles like bogs and thick wood. According to Adam of Bremen''s description in the Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum about 1075 AD states that it ran from the Elbe river near Boizenburg northwards along the Bille river to the mouth of the Schwentine at the Kiel Fjord and the Baltic Sea. It was breached several times by the Slavic Obotrites (983 and 1086) and Mieszko II Lambert of Poland (1028 and 1030). The Limes became irrelevant during the first phase of the Ostsiedlung, when Count Henry of Badewide campaigned against the Wagrian lands in 1138/39 and the Slavic population was Germanized by German, mostly Saxon, new settlers. Limes represents the first aspect of colonisation- the establishment of an imperial boundary.',
'Civitas Finitima was a fontier settlement. These regional capitals were considered fairly dangerous places since enemies, either military, political, cultural or economic were beyond the very close boundary of the ''empire'' or faction. Nonethless it was exactly for this reason that populations quickly swelled into these areas where trade and commerce was seen as a worthwhile endeavour and poorer people or those wishing to escape oppression and indentured service in the homelands could establish new lands and farmsteads in the colonies- typically using the old population as serfs or slaves.',
'To accept a province as a vassal, was to recognise its status as part of the realm and usually given to a specific governor. Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus "servant", a term used as part of feudalism in medieval Europe, where one enters into mutual obligations to a monarch, usually in the form of military support and mutual protection, in exchange for certain privileges, usually to include land held as a fiefdom. This system can be applied to similar systems in other feudal societies. Although related, a fidelity, or fidelitas, is somewhat different as it is a sworn loyalty, subject to the king. The stratification of a fighting band of vassals into an upper group composed of great territorial magnates, strong enough to ensure the inheritance of their benefice to the heirs of their family, and a lower group of landless knights attached to a "count" or "duke" might roughly be correlated with the new term "fief" that was superseding "benefice" in the 9th century. The social settling out process also received impetus in fundamental changes in conducting warfare. As the example of the Huns demonstrated to the Romanised world that cavalry superseded a melee of fighting men on foot in determining the outcome of battles, the cost of maintenance of a mounted and increasingly armoured fighting force was inflated. A mounted vassal needed wealth to equip the band of mounted fighters he was under obligation to contribute to his lord''s frequent disputes, and wealth, where a money economy had disappeared, was only to be found in land and its productions, which included peasants, as much a resource of the land as wood and water.',
'A commendation ceremony (commendatio) is a formal ceremony that evolved during the Early Medieval period to create a bond between a lord and his fighting man, called his vassal (Latin vassus). The first recorded ceremony of commendatio was in 7th century France, but the relationship of vassalage was older, and predated even the medieval formulations of a noble class. The lord''s "servant" (vassus) might be born unfree, but the commendatio freed him. When two men entered into a feudal relationship, they underwent a ceremony known as commendation ceremony. The purpose of the commendation was to make a chosen person a vassal of a lord. The commendation ceremony is composed of two elements, one to perform the act of homage and the other an oath of fealty. The physical position for Western Christian prayer that is thought of as typical today—kneeling, with hands clasped—originates from the commendation ceremony. Before this time, European Christians prayed in the orans, which is the Latin, or "praying" position that people of many religions had used in antiquity: standing, with hands outstretched, a gesture still used today in many Christian rituals and deriving from a pagan salute to the sun forming a bodily cross. The kneeling and clasped hands position was to signify an almost bound position as if the hands and feet were tied, this showed that the servant was mentally and physically subject to the lord.',
'The fief (alternatively, fee, feoff, fiefdom) or feudum (in Latin), under the system of medieval European feudalism, often consisted of inheritable lands or revenue-producing property granted by a lord to a vassal who held seisin in return for a form of allegiance (usually given by homage and fealty). Not only land but anything of value could be held in fief, such as an office, a right of exploitation (e.g., hunting, fishing) or any other type of revenue, rather than the land it comes from. In the 10th and 11th centuries the term "fief" (feudum) could be used either to describe dependent tenure held by a man from his lord, as the term is used now by historians, or it could mean simply "property". It lacked a precise meaning until the middle of the 12th century, when it received formal definition from land lawyers. Historically the fiefs of the 11th and the 12th century derived from two separate sources. The first was land carved out of the estates of the upper nobility. The second source was allodial land transformed into dependent tenures. During the 10th century in northern France and the 11th century in France south of the Loire, local magnates either recruited or forced the owners of allodial holdings into dependent relationships and they were turned into fiefs. The process occurred later in Germany, and was still going on in the 13th century. In 13th-century England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy the term "feodum" was used to describe a dependent tenure held from a lord by a vassal in return for a specified amount of knight service and occasional financial payments (feudal incidents).',

'Conscription represents the call to arms in a region, where the ruler raises a national army for rapid deployment. Conscription buildings allow European factions to quickly gain access to a wide range of units without the need for a developed military infrastucture such as stables, barracks or bowyers. Instead, each tier of the conscription allows a mix of unit types dependent on social class. The higher the conscription level the more elite and noble the units available. Be careful however, conscription was extremely unpopular with the people, and should only be used in emergencies for defence or summoning large armies for a campaign. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands! This level requires Provincial Charters, and allows access to levies from the countryside.',
'Conscription level 2 allows access to units of militia level, usually from town guards or peasant classes.

'The term quintain (O. Fr. quintaine/quintaina, from Lat. quintana, a street between the fifth and sixth maniples of a camp, where warlike exercises took place), also known as pavo (or peacock), was often used to refer collectively to a number of lance games, often used as training for jousting, where the competitor would attempt to strike an object with his lance, sword or other weapon. The common object was a shield or board on a pole (usually referred to, confusingly, as ''the quintain''), although a mannikin was sometimes used. It was not unknown for a seated armoured knight to act as the target. This game was open to all, popular with young men of all classes. While the use of horses aided in training for the joust, the game could be played on foot, using a wooden horse or on boats (popular in 12th-century London). This military training tended to keep the lads out of trouble!',
'Hastilude is a generic term used in the Middle Ages to refer to many kinds of martial games. The word comes from the Latin hastiludium, literally "lance game"''. By the 14th century, the term usually excluded tournaments and was used to describe the other games collectively; this seems to have coincided with the increasing preference for ritualistic and individualistic games over the traditional mêlée style. It draw spectators from afar, which allowed trade and fairs, but also brought crime, prositution and the spread of diseases from travellers shacked into rough conditions.',
'Roger of Hoveden (1174 - 1201), an English chronicler., described tournaments as "military exercises carried out, not in the spirit of hostility (nullo interveniente odio), but solely for practice and the display of prowess (pro solo exercitio, atque ostentatione virium)." During the Early Middle Ages such cavalry games were still central to military training as is evidenced by Louis and Charles'' military games at Worms in 843. At this event, recorded by Nithard, the initial chasing and fleeing was followed by a general melee of all combatants. But the tournament, properly so called, does not appear in Europe before the 11th century. Medieval people themselves devised myths about its origins. A chronicler of Tours in the late twelfth century records the death, in 1066, of an Angevin baron named Geoffroi de Preulli, who supposedly "devised (invenit) tournaments." Tournaments centred on the melee, a general fight where the knights were divided into two sides and came together in a charge (MFr ''estor''). Jousting, a single combat of two knights riding at each other, was a component of the tournament, but was never its main feature. Knights would come from all over Christendom as a means to make a name for themselves, advertise their services to foreign royalties who might wish to recruit them into their retinues or offices of command. It was also a chance to court princesses.',
'The pas d''armes or passage of arms was a type of chivalric hastilude that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. It involved a knight or group of knights (tenans) who would stake out a traveled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass (venans or "comers") must first fight, or be disgraced. If a traveling venan did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the venan chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way. There are many thousands of accounts of pas d''armes during this period. One notable and special account is that of Suero de Quiñones who in 1433 established the Passo Honroso ("Pass[age] of Honour") at the Órbigo bridge in Castile. This road was used by pilgrims all over Europe on the way to shrine at Santiago de Compostela and it was June when thousands would pass. Suero and ten knights promised to fight 300 times ("break 300 lances") before leaving the pas d''armes. He and his men fought for over a month, an account of which is left to us in great detail by town notary Don Luis Alonso Luengo who kept a first-hand chronicle (later published as Libro del Passo honroso). After 166 battles Suero and his men were so injured they could not continue and declared the mission complete. Although it sounds very honourable, this manner of picking fights from every man of sergeant and noble class meant that vendettas and claims on each others'' estates quickly descended into turmoil.',
'It was in the Middle Ages when the practice of fighting bulls with spears (lanceo) started. It is known that Alfonso X the Wise patronised the sport. A contemporary chronicle says about 1128: "Alfonso (the VII) married in Saldaña with Berenguela, daughter of the Count of Barcelona, and, within other entertainments, there were bullfights". These spectacles were developed in public squares and open places as part of the celebrations for military victories, patron saint festivities and festivals, although at the own risk of the spectators!',
'Its nine members, the Priori, were chosen from the ranks of the guilds of the city: six of them from the major guilds, and two from the minor guilds. The ninth became the Gonfaloniere of Justice. The names of all guild members over thirty years old were put in eight leather bags called borse. Every two months these bags were taken from the church of Santa Croce, where they were ordinarily kept, and in a short ceremony drawn out at random. Only men who were not in debt, had not served a recent term, and had no relation to the names of men already drawn, would be considered eligible for office.',
'In undertaking their governmental duties, the Signoria was required to consult two other elected councils collectively known as Collegi. The first was the Dodici Buonomini, with twelve members these ''good men'' served as a form of parliament. The four city Quartieri, quarters, by which Florens was partitioned would four times a year chose 3 men (I dodici Buonomini), vwith a mandate period of 3 months. 9 of the Good Men were from the greater merchant guilds Arti maggiori and an additional three were from the lesser Arti minori. Together with the overall Signoria and later the sixteen gonfalonieri they made up the three great Councils or Collegi which formed the great Council (Consigli).',
'In undertaking their governmental duties, the Signoria was required to consult two other elected councils collectively known as Collegi. The second of these was the Collegio dei Sedici Gonfaloniere, a ''College'' of Sixteen city ''standard-bearers''. Each of the four city-quarters had four banner-bearers representing the actual quarter rather than the clans and merchant houses from those quarters themselves. These ''sesti'' were often also sports teams, and had as symbols on their banners- golden lions, rhions, eagle or dragons. When at war these sesti would make up various military companies under these banners. In the age of the Condottieri it was the Gonfaloniere that evolved into the mercenary Companies, often named after the banner they had originally marched under.In governmental practive, this council represented the ''lower house''.',
'The Council of the Eight of War was usually a temporary formation, and specifically focussed on leading a military campaign. They were most famous during the Conflict with the Avignon Papacy where the war was named after them ''War of the Eight Saints''. These men were highly regarded with their trustworthiness. 2 were chosen from the lesser and major guilds respectively and four from the most powerful of the Famiglia houses.',
'Similar to the warcouncil of Eight, this was a temporary formation for emergency civil supervision, usually working in tandem with the war council. Actually formed of clerics loyal to the Signoria, and usually themselves members of the major Famiglia. The council would raise taxes and specifically target religious institutions. During the War of the Eight Saints they managed to bribe the English Condottiero John Hawkwood from his employment in Papal service with a sum well over 130,000 florins, three years later the settlement and truce to the war paid the Papacy 200,000 florins. Ironically in both cases the massive sums were culled from seizing all Church taxes (usually a tenth of all regional income) as well as raiding some monasteries and sites, taking land or gold from the altars.',
'This Council of the Eight was an extension of the temporrary war council, and a more longstanding group who were repsonsible for continued garrisoning and defence forces, as well as state security and police. The Balia were democratically chosen by lots, and used the Il libro dello Specchio register of taxation to screen candidates so that no financially indebted families would be eligible since personal finances were a factor. Furthermore the ''regime'' il Reggimento was to eliminate unpopular famiglia and merchant houses, often non-Florentine ''colonists'' who had branches in the city by setting extreme taxes which they simply could not pay- the merchant company had its assets seized and was forcibly evicted from the city.',
'One of the older palaces upon which the Palazzo Vecchio was built in 1299, the Palace of Infantry was a purely regimental headquarters and naturally formed a primarily defensive corps made of militia. It was extremely effective in running the expensive standing military companies. When the Vecchio was built it was an office incorporated into the new structure.',
'One of the older palaces upon which the Palazzo Vecchio was built in 1299, the Palace of the Executor of Justice was a major judicial office. It was extremely effective in maintaining strict control over the financial goings-on within the different merchant Houses and guilds. The office had full access and partial rights to edit the the Il libro dello Specchio register of taxation. When the Vecchio was built it was an office incorporated into the new structure.',
'The Palazzo dei Priori evolved into the Palazzo della Signoria, the Priori itself were the Guild-collective and council in fact made up of Signoria. It was also known as Palazzo Vecchio (Old Palace) Palazzo del Popolo and Palazzo Ducale depending on the exact form of government at the time. Immediately after the Signoria representatives were elected into their respective Collegi, they were expected to move into the Palazzo della Signoria, where they would remain for the two months of their office. There they were paid a modest sum to cover their expenses and were provided with green-liveried servants. The Priori had a uniform of crimson coats, lined with ermine and with ermine collars and cuffs.',

'Curatorships were the first step in the establishment of foreign rule by Italian states. Since most Italian city-states were themselves republics modelled on the old Roman order, a colony was under no legal obligation as under an empire. The appearance of freedom within a conquered territory was represented by a series of small artificial governments. Each government would be led by a curator, who like a mayor would rule the trade, tax, law, construction and levy system within each zone. Each region tended to be made up of several small curatoriae.',
'The rulers of the giudicati were ''giudici'' from the Latin for judge, iudice. Each giudicato was a regional capital that was designed to govern the curatoriae, which as they developed required more and more attention. Like the curatorships upon which they were modelled, a giudicato had formally power over law, trade and tax and this extended to military control also. Since each ''judge'' controlled several curatoriae, naturally his province was potentially quite vast. The giudicati were in some cases colonies of the Italian city-states and in other cases became so successful, wealthy and powerful that they were themselves rival autonomies or minor kingdoms. Rival city-states such as Genoa and Pisa would fight desperately for control over giudicati. For instance, the last Sardinian giudicato was sold to the Aragonese in the 1400s for approximately 40,000 florins.',
'Run by a consul of a republic, these states were so powerful that they were principalities in their own right. A consul-prince of such as state would be a major player in the politics of his vassal state, and although technically a colony his state could reasonably challenge the dominance of his parent country. A principality if your subject can be useful for raising the strength of a colonial region to an autonomy, as well as the man that controls it. However, the risks of rebellion are far greater with a principality than with the county autonomies of other factions since a prince is a higher degree than most dukes, and most Italian states are themselves merely duchies at most.',
'Corporazioni delle arti e mestieri were the ''guilds of the artisans'', which in the Italian republics were the foundation of free commerce and the power houses of the merchant class. They were secular corporations that controlled the arts and trades in cities such as Florence and Milan and dominated southern European politics from the twelfth century. These Arti included seven major guilds (collectively known as the arti maggiori), five middle guilds (arti mediane) and nine minor guilds (arti minori). Their rigorous quality control and the political role in the commune that the Art Maggiori assumed were formative for their respective republics. Six of the nine Priori of the Signoria of Florence were selected from the major guilds, and two were selected by the minor guilds. The guilds were the medieval institution within which were organized every aspect of a city''s economic life, forming a social network that complemented and in part compensated for family ties, although in Florence the welfare side of the guilds'' activities was less than in many cities. The first of the guilds of Florence of which there is notice is the Arte di Calimala, the cloth-merchants'' guild, mentioned in a document of about 1150. By 1193 there existed seven such corporate bodies, which each elected a council whose members bore the Roman-sounding designation consoli. A single capo was elected to manage all the business of the guild. Entrance to the Arti was highly structured from the first records; it was necessary to be the legitimate son of a member, to give proofs of competence in the craft involved, and to pay an entrance tax. Masters of the guilds, who possessed the means of production, took on apprentices and garzoni, the "boys" or journeymen who might work through a long career without ever becoming a master. Each of the Arti was ruled according to its statutes, which had the force of law, and might pass judgement in controversies among its members and with their workers. As elsewhere, the guilds of Florence protected its members from competition within the city by outsiders, guaranteed the quality of work through strict supervision of the workshops (botteghe), stipulated work hours, established markets and feast days, and provided public services to its members, and their wives, widows and children. In later centuries city watchmen were also organized by the Arti to protect closed workshops and warehouses.',
'The Arti Minori were the so-called ''lesser guilds'' which were made up of tradesmen connected with the agricultural sector such as millers and wine merchants, but also included all the industries related to the military such as leather workers, saddle-makers, armourers and wood-workers. A focus on wine production and the arms industry was naturally not always a good mix in a city despite their fundamental value to overall infrastructure.',
'The Middle Guilds were made up of a mixed lot, for instance they included the livestock merchants, probably raised from importance over the lesser guilds due to their provision for wool which was so essential to the Major Guilds. They also included ironworkers and stonemasons which oddly contrasted to the Lesser Guilds'' woodworkers and armourers.',
'The Major Guilds covered several trades but what they had in common was that they were elite of the commune and allowed a control from the top down, they included the wealthiest merchants such as silk-weavers but also doctors, bankers and lawyers. They held power over the rest of the guilds usually due to their wealth and access to judicial and administrative processes. They were also very well-represented in the offices of the republic and the senatorial priori, meaning that they were the dominant force behind government. This oligarchic elite, although undisputedly of value to any republic and the economy were widely reviled by the populace.',
'Maiores referred to the ''important persons'' which more specifically differentiated from inferiores ''lesser men'' by meaning that a specific recognisable elite existed in the city. These ''great men'' were entitled knights, judges or doctors- and it was only these that were allowed to wear the symbol of their state- ''a doublet of silk and magisterially slashed shoes''. This uniform is apparent from several medieval portraits and frescoes from the period. Politicians such as the Nine of Siena were typical magnates of this class. However what was also typical of this time was effecting this dress and pretensions to the magisterial rank. Amongst these were the Noveschi banking families of Seina, who ironically did in fact themselves come to dominate republican politics and government over time. The Noveschi and their like in other Italian cities were not of a single famiglia or house but by definition married into and often literally bought into (either through expensive dowries or illegal means) the entitled nobility, therefore their powers and factionalism spread quickly. Predominantly they were bankers, since they had the access to money, documents, records, investments in trade and could legally loan out to noble estates, titles and knights etc which in the case of failure to repay would allow the bankers to confiscate the assets and symbolically even the very rank of the nobility. Their acquisition of power could be ruthless and brutal but where there was money... well, cash was king.',
'A maona or Societas comperarum was a medieval Italian association of investors formed to manage the purchased shares (loca or partes) of the revenue due to the relevant city-state through tax farming; the shares were individually sold to wealthy merchants, but the collection could be difficult and so these merchants would band together. These organizations were usually temporary, and could sometimes be extremely aggressive in extracting the monies due them; their actions went up to, and included, outright conquest. Maona were especially common in Genoa. The origins of the concept of joint investment combined with joint (private) enforcement can be traced back to trade financing in Mesopotamia. The linguistic roots of the Arabic word Maounach can best be translated as help or helping each other. Once the conquest of Chios was successfully achieved, the ship-owners then returned to Genoa and advanced the sum of 250,000 lire to cover the expenses of the compaign. After long deliberations, an agreement was concluded on 26 February 1347 between the Commune and the group of its creditors represented by Simone Vignoso, this association took the name of the Maona of Chios. The debt owed to the ship-owners was repaid in shares, or luoghi, to an amount of 203,000 lire Genovesi. This was less than the commanders of the ships demanded, but nonetheless they acquired property and the administration of Chios and two phocaeas, in addition to the revenues provided by the luoghi. The more-or-less forced benevolence of the ship-owners made up for the deficiencies of the state, which was then obliged to hand over public revenues to them to meet its obligations. Maona can be seen as the primary social movement in capitalism and investment banking.',
'The Collegii Drapariorum (College or Office of Drapers) or Priorato delle Arti (Priory of the Guilds) -most importantly included the Arte della lana (wool), Arte della calimala (cloth), Arte della Seta (silk) -these were the essential economic parties behind the entire Italian dominance on trade, often called an actual monopoly- such as they aggressively acquired in several times and places such as most famously in Constantinople with dire consequences. Created in 1282 in Florence the first Priorato delle Arti, was an organ initially of three priori mentioned above but later on become six, elected from among twenty-one of the Corporations of the trades and guilds. The Priory itself included the College technically, although it was due to the power of the three guilds- tightly fused. Along with the Capitano del Populo they represented the executive and representative power; they convened the Councils and were superior to all the officials of the republic. They had direct access to the communal treasury and naturally the whole institution leant itself to corruption. It was for this reason therefore a directory of noble families were excluded from the governmental functions and with it the figure of the Gonfaloniere di Giustizia, who was in fact created to preside over the priori in assignment over ordering the higher political system.',
'The Tribunale della Mercanzia (Tribunal of Merchandise) was where lawyers judged disputes and rival claims between merchants. These investigations and proceedings could be extremely complex, involving economic as well as judicial ''warfare'' between rival houses and often involved conspiracies and politics. Considering the massive importance that the merchant class had for the power and wealth of the Italian republics, this tribunal- although hardly immune to corruption- was a vast step forward in controlling the civil conflicts.',
'A General Code, "Il Statuto", for the guilds was promulgated in 1296 with the founding of the Corte della Mercanzia (Court of Commerce). The Statutes of all the guilds in Florence underwent a complete revision between 1301 and 1307, and the "New Code" was first adopted by the Calimala (Wool merchants'' guild) who set the standard for all to follow due to their key placement between the various arms of the guilds castes; the statutes were again revised in 1386. All of which was thanks to what appears to have been a successfully democratic attempt to maintain fairness of practices and trade rights, as well as civil rights for the workers. Various cities across Italy exhalted these institutions with their own palazzos, piazzas and loggia.',

'As lords and land owners are forced to employ large armies to protect and realise their interests, that also sees large scale trade growing exponentially, money lending is becoming a fact of life among the wealthy. The bank, or ‘Chamber of Loans’ is the residence of the business established to oversee and maintain records of money lending. Some merchants even use the building to store funds for safekeeping… a strange concept.',

'Chapter house, although the establishment of an Order was a Chapter House of sorts it was usually referred to as a Domus. This Domus was typically a chapel monastery, naturally being a militarised order in addition to the farmland around the House to provide for the monks (sergeants, knights and laymen) it was neccessary to have grazing pastures for the warhorses and training grounds for the troops. The stables and armouries were typically adjoined with a blacksmith and even over time a small village would grow up outside of the Domus and its estates to support the chapter, all of this formed a small settlement or ''capital'' which acted as a proper base of logisitics for the Order in the region.',
'Mansion Estate. As a Chapter House grew in size and the forces it housed grew in number, the civilian support around the ''barracks'' would also increase exponentially. Typically the chapter would require its own estates much like any other monastery, hwoever due to the logistics of running a small military cohort there was a long list of administrative duties that had to be considered. The Mansio acted as an office for the accounts, records and provision of law over the estate, although it provided jobs for the civilians in the area it also ate up considerable tracts of arable land from the populace. Furthermore being an ecclesiastical institution it was land and manpower that was tax exempt, in fact it actually drained tax from the region due to the Church tithe.',
'A preceptory was historically the headquarters of any of the various orders of Christian Knights, such as the Knights Hospitaller and Templar, within a given geographic area. Governed by a preceptor, who was answerable to the Grand Master of the respective order. A preceptory''s main focus would be its church and accommodation for the brethren. Like any monastery it acted as a religious base in the province, but a preceptory was more in line with an Abbey in fact, so it had considerable effect in its locality. With such a large establishment its side-effects on the regional economy were increased, but on the other hand so was the power and efficiency of the military aspect. Local knights and sergeants would pay into the Order in order to receive a regular pay and more stable livelihood than trying to run their own estates. This is one reason the Orders became to popular and powerful, in fact they impacted on the power of the kings since his vassals were giving up their feudal service to him, their feudal command over the peasantry and donating their estates to the Order -making them Donati.',
'The Commandry was to all intents and purposes a Preceptory. It was a large base of operations and administration for an Order. Usually seen as the smallest division of an Order''s powers it was also its foundation- for it was via the network of these bases that recruitment, training, income and political influence emerged. What set a Commandry apart from a straightforward Preceptory was the heightened emphasis on military command. The Teutonic Order called their Commanderies; Kommende or Komturei which also has the meaning of ''office'' stemming from the French comptoir from the Latin computare - or ''calculate''. Therefore Commandries can be seen as essential headquarters for regional Order forces.',
'A keep or tower, this basic fortification was the prime defensive expansion of a commandry. Keeps were common structures in Europe, probably descended from Roman structures in design and function. A tower had natural practical benefits of allowing a raised lookout to see potential threats approaching, it also allowed missiles to be directed with better accuracy and power on attackers. The added pyschological effect of a tall imposing building increased belief in government in the area.',
'Fortification. A castellum was a small Roman detached fort used as a watch tower or signal station. The Latin word castellum is the source of the English word "castle", and was used in medieval times to cover a wide range of military defences. In the context of Militarised Monastic Orders, a castellum was major base of operations, usually found in frontier provinces such as the frontlines against Muslims or pagans in the Baltics, Iberia or the Holy Land. Naturally the cost of funding not only the contstruction of such a large site, but the manning of military and civilian support was very high. An Order''s castellum would include all the structrures needed to maintain, equip, feed and train a crusader army. A ruler would build such structures for the Orders, to encourage them to prosper and garrison his frontiers. Since the Orders were largely self-contained once they were up and running it was something of an investment.',
'Citadel. The Latin word castrum, was used by the ancient Romans to mean buildings or plots of land reserved to or constructed for use as a military defensive position. In classical Latin the word castra always means "great legionary encampment", both "marching", "temporary" ones and the "fortified permanent" ones, while the diminutive form castellum was used for the smaller forts, which were usually, but not always, occupied by the auxiliary units and used as logistic bases for the legions, as explained by Vegetius. In Latin the term Castrum is much more frequently used as proper name of geographical locations. In the Middle Ages, Castrum or Castrorum was naturally widely used in a variety of meanings, but in the context of the Militarised Monastic Orders it represented the paramount tier of operational bases such as the famous Templar headquarters in the Holy Land: Karak. A castrum was more than just a walled, towered structure it was a self-contained city including Horreae (granaries), Valetudinarium (hospital), Veterinarium (for horses), Fabrica ("workshop", metals and wood) and the Retentura ("stretching to the rear") was also a safekeep for plunder and a prison for hostages and high-ranking enemy captives. Of course more mundane amenities also existed in planned locations within the walls such as stone ovens for baking bread, latrines for hygiene, wells and irrigation ditches in hotter climates to augment agriculture.',
'Though it is incredibly common for peasant boys to learn how to string a bow as they grow up, any lord seeking to field a unit of archers or crossbowmen will first need to employ a professional Bowyer. Essentially a specialised carpenter, a bowyer has all the equipment needed to shape and treat bow wood, twine and resin for bow strings, as well as a healthy supply of bird feathers, for the rather mundane task of fletching countless arrows.',
'An Archery Range is a necessary investment for any lord seeking to train professional missile troops, rather than rely upon militia-level training with local peasants. Improvements to the range include much more challenging targets to practise on, officer’s quarters, and a larger bowyer’s workshop outfitted to manufacture superior weaponry, worthy of highly trained soldiers.',

'The Order of Mountjoy (French: Ordre de Montjoie, Spanish: Orden de Monte Gaudio) was a military order during the crusades. The period of the Crusades witnessed the rise of religious orders and Christian military orders. The order of Montjoie is mentioned in the thirteenth century as having been founded for the purpose of protecting Christian pilgrims in Iberian Peninsula. Its existence was brief, having been established c.1180 and united with the Order of Calatrava in 1221.The order was founded by count Rodrigo Álvarez in the Holy Land. Rodrigo was from the order of Santiago, and had already established the order in Castile and Aragon before establishing it in the kingdom of Jerusalem in the tower of Ascalon. The headquarters of the order was situated on Montjoie, the hill where the original crusaders had first seen Jerusalem, hence its name ("mountain of joy", mons gaudii in Latin, Mont de joie in French, contracted in Montjoie). The rule of the order was adapted from the Cistercian rule, and was entirely a Spanish order. The emblem of the order was a red and white cross. A number of knights from the order fought at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, but none of them survived. Discontentment with the leadership of the master Fralmo in 1196 led to the establishment of a new Order of Monfragüe in Castile while the Aragonese element of the order was merged with Templars. In 1221 Ferdinand III of Castile joined the order of Monfragüe to the Order of Calatrava. In the twelfth century Monfragüe was the centre of a Mountjoy commandary before it became the headquarters of its own order. The earliest reference to the commandary is in an economic transaction involving the commander, Gonzalo Padilla, and his fellow brothers (freyes, freires) of the Order. As early as 1186 the Order had tried to amalgamate with the Templars but failed. The final split within the Order of Mountjoy occurred only with the Templar merger in 1196. The discontents managed to hold onto Monfragüe, which they made their centre of operations, and make Rodrigo González their master. They were confined to Castile. Alfonso VIII of Castile was the principal benefactor of the Order. The first document confirming the existence of the Order of Monfragüe was promulgated at San Miguel de Sortello on 13 January 1197 by Alfonso, who granted to the order and its master, Rodrigo González, an annual rent of fifteen cahices toledanos of salt from the mines of Talavera amongst many large donations. All of which secured the Order to the Crown as a nationalist political force. At Segovia, on 23 May 1221, Ferdinand III granted all the rights and castles, including Monfragüe, to the Order of Calatrava, effectively merging the smaller order into the larger although this was not finalised until 1245. After the abolition of the Templars in 1312, James II of Aragon was counselled to revive the Order of Mountjoy or the Holy Redeemer and grant Templar lands to it with Montesa as its headquarters. This became the Order of Montesa or Order of Trufac.',
'The Order of Calatrava (Spanish: Orden de Calatrava) was the first military order founded in Castile, but the second to receive papal approval. The papal bull confirming the Order of Calatrava as a Militia was given by Pope Alexander III on September 26, 1164. In 1214 Alcántara was first committed to the care of the Castilian Knights of Calatrava, who had lately received great support after their performance in 1212 at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa against the Almohades. Alonzo of León wished to found at Alcántara a special branch of this celebrated order for his realm. However, four years later the Order decided that the post was too far from its Castilian headquarters. They gave up the scheme and transferred the castle, with the permission of the king, to a peculiar Leonese order still in a formative stage, known as Knights of St. Julian de Pereiro. Therefore the two Orders were initially one, Alcántara are first acknowledged as a military order by a papal bull in 1177 by Pope Alexander III. Through their compact with the Knights of Calatrava, they accepted the Cistercian rule and costume, (a white mantle with the scarlet overcross), and they submitted to the right of inspection and correction from the Master of Calatrava. The Knights of Alcántara, under their new name, acquired many castles and estates, for the most part at the expense of the Muslims. They amassed great wealth from booty during the war and from pious donations. It was a turning point in their career. However, ambitions and dissensions increased among them. The post of grand master became the aim of rival aspirants. In 1318, the Grand Master, Ruy Vaz, was besieged by his own Knights, sustained in this by the Grand Master of Calatrava. This rent in their body produced no less than three grand masters in contention, supported severally by the Knights, by the Cistercians, and by the king. The rise of such dissensions could be attributed to the fact that military orders had lost the chief object of their vocation when the Moors were driven from their last foothold in the Iberian Peninsula. the Order of Calatrava owes its origin not to any deliberately prepared plan, but to fortuitous circumstances, the recital of which was known by the pen of Rodrigo of Toledo: "Calatrava is the Arabic name of a castle recovered from the Moslems, in 1147, by the King of Castile, Alfonso VII, called el Emperador. Located in what was then the southernmost border of Castile, this conquest was more difficult to keep than to make, especially at a time with neither standing armies nor garrisons were known. In part to correct this deficiency, the military orders such as Knights Templars were founded, where men could fulfill a vow of perpetual war against the Muslim. The Templars, however, were unable to hold Calatrava, and the king found further volunteer warriors when Raymond, Abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Fitero offered himself. This step is said to have been suggested to the abbot by Father Diego Velázquez, a simple monk, but one who had been a knight, and thus was well acquainted with military matters. Diego was inspired with the idea of employing the lay brothers of the abbey to defend Calatrava. These Cistercian lay brothers--at that time a recent innovation in monastic life--not being in Holy orders, were variously employed in manual trades such as those of tending herds, construction, farm labor, or husbandry. Diego recommended that they become soldiers of the Cross. Thus a new order was created in 1157. Motivated by the desire for religious and pecuniary rewards, these brethren were eager to take the offensive against the Moors." In 1221 the Order of Monfragüe was also merged into that of Calatrava. after the definitive coalition of Castile and León (1229), in (1235) captured the capital of the old caliphate, Córdoba, soon afterwards Murcia, Jaén, and Seville. The European crusade seemed at an end, yet the Order could boast no fewer than 2000 knights, and this standing force became a political power within Iberia, with the title of Grandmaster equal to that of an autonomous prince.',

'The Order of Montesa was inspired partly by the suggestion to re-establish Montjoie after the suppression of the Templars. This Order was also known as the Order of Trufac. The Order of Montesa (Arabic: Orden de Montesa‎, Catalan: Ordre de Montesa, Spanish: Orden de Montesa) is a Christian military order, territorially limited to the old Kingdom of Aragon. The Templars had been received with enthusiasm in Aragon from their foundation in 1128. King Alfonso I of Aragon, having no direct heir, bequeathed his dominions to be divided among the Templars, the Knights Hospitaller, and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, but this bequest was annulled by his subjects in 1131. The Templars had to be contented with certain castles, the chief of which was Monzón. Although the Aragonese branch of the order was pronounced innocent at the famous trial of the Templars, Pope Clement V''s Bull of suppression was applied to them in spite of the protests of King James II of Aragon in 1312. King James II persuaded Pope John XXII to permit him to regroup the Templar properties in Aragon and Valencia, and to create a new military order not essentially differing from that of the Templars, which should be charged with the defence of the frontier against the Moors and the pirates. The new order was dedicated to Our Lady, and based at Montesa. Pope John XXII approved it on 10 June 1317, and gave it the Cistercian rule. The order derived its title from St. George of Montesa, its principal stronghold. It was affiliated to the Order of Calatrava, from which its first recruits were drawn, and it was maintained in dependence upon that order. The first of the fourteen grand masters was Guillermo d''Eril. In 1485, Philip of Viana renounced the Archdiocese of Palermo to become grand master. He died fighting the Kingdom of Granada in 1488. The office of grand master was united with the Crown by Philip II in 1587.',

'The Roman Curia is the administrative apparatus of the Holy See and the central governing body of the entire Catholic Church, together with the Pope. It coordinates and provides the necessary central organization for the correct functioning of the Church and the achievement of its goals. Every Bishopric has its own Curia, or council- these comprise members with mundane functions such as the butler and steward, to more administrative employees such as secretaries and emissaries. The Roman Curia is perhaps the oldest and indeed the model curia, comprising a vast organisation of Cardinals and officers, many working directly with representatives from the major states of Christendom. The Curia is the head of the Ecclesia in Urbe, or Church in Rome and represents its fundamental organisation.',
'The Lateran Palace was originally the Domus Faustae or "House of Fausta," a structure given to the Bishop of Rome by Constantine. In the tenth Century Sergius III restored it after a disastrous fire, and later it was greatly embellished by Innocent III. This was the period of its greatest magnificence, when Dante speaks of it as beyond all human achievements. At this time the centre of the piazza was occupied by the palace and tower of the Annibaldi family. ',
'The whole of the front of the Lateran Palace was taken up with the Aula Concilii ("Hall of the Council"), a magnificent hall with eleven apses, in which were held the various Councils of the Lateran during the medieval period. The private apartments of the popes in this palace were situated between this Triclinium and the city walls. This Hall of the Council was the Pope''s main court to receive guests and emissaries in a ceremonial and official capacity, it was also the seat of the major events that would effect Christendom, such as for proposals for Crusades and other such international matters of state.',
'Here the acts, privileges and mandates (papa’s correspondence) of the papacy were drawn up, sealed and sent off. Highest official cancellarius (the chancellor). Staff also included 7 regional notaries (scrinarii) and other scribes. From the late 11th century the staff of a papal chapel often served here. Many distinguished canonists (legal experts) served in the chancery, including Sinibaldo Fieschi, the later Pope Innocent IV. The office itself is very old, but the term cancellaria is not found before the late 12th century. ',
'This is the central board of finance in the Papal administrative system, of great importance in the government of the States of the Church, and in the administration of justice within the ''Roman Nation'' itself. It was mainly an extension of the Curia with a heavy financial focus -such as taxes and tithes. The collection of the crusade taxes, regularly assessed after the time of Innocent III (1198-1216), imposed new duties on the papal treasury, to which were committed both the collection and distribution of these assessments. Moreover, during the course of this century the system of payment in kind was transformed into the monetary system, a process considerably influenced by the administration of the papal finances. The servitia communia of bishops and abbots (see Annates) were regulated at fixed sums. The income regularly yielded by them to the Curia was massive, each Church tithe in all of Christian Europe received one tenth of each regional income, of this a large portion would make its way to Rome itself. Naturally the officers of this institution were amongst the highest authorities in the Papacy.',
'An assembly of cardinals (cardinal-bishops (episcopi cardinales), cardinal-priests (presbyteri cardinales) and cardinal-deacons (diaconi cardinales), evolved from the Curia Romana (Roman Curia), who elect papa (since 1179) and advice and assist him. The cardinals had been given the right to elect papa in the decree of 1059 by Nicholas II (during the minority of Henry IV), but problems concerning the text and its interpretation led to problems, such as the election of two papas, Anacletus II and Innocent II in the 12th century. The term to denote the regular meetings of the Sacred College of Cardinals presided by papa is consistory ',
'A key institution in the government of the late medieval Stati Pontifici. Established at about the second half of the 12th century. Originally the means for the administration of penance for the pilgrims & penitents coming to Rome, but its field expanded significantly during the 13th century because of the various decretals which gave solely to papa the power of absolution and dispensation concerning a great number of violations of ecclesiastical law. This resulted in a growing number of offenders from all the Catholic countries going to Rome. It wasn’t possible or even necessary for papa himself to deal with most of these cases, so other officials, the most significant of which was the major penitentiary, took this task in his stead. Important influence on the moral life of the Europe.',
'Before papal letters presumed to be contentious were sealed, they were read out to the representatives of the concerned parties. It was the task of the head of audientia, called auditor litterarum contradictarum - a particularly important chancery official - to either order them to be sent out or commence an investigation concerning the letters and the objections raised. The auditor was one of the most important "offices" of the chancery. Audientia litterarum contradictarum was already in existence during the pontificate of Innocent III and flourished for several centuries. In the 15th century decline had already set in with the rise of new institutions (such as Signatura gratiae) and with the decentralization of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. ',
'A supreme ecclesiastical court. Came to existence in the 14th century. Possibly the word "rota" refers to the table in Rome around which papa, cardinals and their advisers sat when dealing with major cases. Its judges were called auditors. The cases which mainly fell to its jurisdiction concerned ecclesiastical benefices. Cases concerning the nullity of marriages were also heard in the Rota, and was a great means to keep spiritual order of the states of Christendom.',
'This links the region inextricably to Rome and the Papacy, protecting it from political and military opposition on pain of Excommunication. For the subject state their was a massive benefit in having Papal protection, but the authority it wielded was practically oppressive- certainly to local magnates and in some respects the local nobility who could no longer serve as administrators with the Papacy intervening.',
'Autocephaly was an alternative to direct Papal rule or Patrimonage (Patrimonium). Due to the extent of Byzantine rule in Italy up to the 11th Century, some city states regardless of Orthodox or Catholic association were still able to acquire autonomy from Rome, whilst remaining in the Papal States themselves. Although rare, this effectively allowed the Pope a form of colonisation which was particularly useful for the states that were in the battlefield with the Emperor during the Investiture Controversy.',
'Although a member state of the Roman Nation, the Pope could not always act with direct authority of his subjected domains. As a patronised city, the chief ruler was the rector an administrator for the local Bishop or religious officer. This allowed the Pope to have a local representative in the city and extend his influence directly.',
'In the thirteenth century the Popes made use of "referendarii" to investigate and prepare the signing - hence the name signatura - of petitions and other cases presented to the Holy See. The Signatura is for overseeing all the tribunals of the Catholic Church, with power to extend the jurisdiction of tribunals, to grant dispensations from procedural laws, to establish interdiocesan tribunals, and to discipline canonical advocates. It was a direct extension of the institutions in Rome such as the Roman Curia, Apostolic Chamber and the Apostolic Penitentiary. Although mainly a single office based in Rome itself it was so widespread an organisation within the Church that its branches spread through all the Papal States.',
'The Aula or Hall, was a form of local palace which when set up outside of Rome allowed the Pope to establish his control and authority more directly in the subject region. Also known as the Papal Court it was the seat of the dignataries who assisted the Pope and his family personally. ',
'The Papal Household was the private domain of the Pope and his family, and his closest advisors and officers. The Papal Court itself was usually defined as the Papal Household, although the Court was a more ceremonial rather than personal institution. In time the two grew together since judicial and civil functions demanded less privacy of the Pope, and a growing presence as a ruler of the people.',
'Although basically a private chapel, the office which administered the ceremonies became more and more public as the private household of the Pope was opened up to public audience. As spiritual head of the church, the chapel became a form of governmental seat.',
'This region has come under the control of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It reports directly to the Papacy, an attack on this settlement is likely to severely effect a faction''s standing with the Pope and cause Excommunication or instigate a Crusade.',
'This is a court for the non-noble Latins, the Bourgeois or Burgher city-dwellers and provides rules for disputes between non-Latins, who have fewer legal rights. It aids law and order naturally but also in financial and administrative matters.',
'This is specifically a financial court, which due to the lack of agricultural land means that the majority of trade is the staple of the Kingdom''s nobility. Not confined to regulating commercial disputes in the markets, it also governs and administrates for the nobles'' fiefs.',
'This was an administrative organisation that was set up to oversee regulation and development of the Syrian population specfically.',
'The lifeblood of the kingdom was the trade across the sea, it brought Christian troops but more importantly exported massive quantities of exotic goods to Europe. The majority of merchants here are Italians, who are typically rivals. Someone needs to regulate taxes, justice and excises.',

'Portugal has always been a country pressed in by its neighbours, especially Castille. This fact made it seek out new areas of expansion and the Atlantic Ocean was the most natural option. Portuguese monarchs (especially Henry the Navigator) believed in this, and they often financed the creation of several institutions aimed at recruiting and teaching new sailors to serve the Crown. Henry the Navigator himself called many famous scientists with expertise in seafaring to his own school (known as the School of Sagres). There he focussed them on research into creating new "mapas portulanos" maps in order to reinforce the expansion of Portugal on the seas.',
'Much like the Azores, it is clear that some knowledge of Atlantic islands, such as Madeira, existed before the discovery and settlement of these lands by Iberians, as the islands appear on maps as early as 1339.',
'The discovery and settlement of the Azores archipelago, much like the islands of Madeira, is one of the more controversial aspects of the Portuguese Age of Discovery. Some chroniclers note that sailors knew of the islands, and visited them during return voyages from the Canary Islands (about 1340-1345), during the reign of King Afonso IV. Officially, the first islands were "discovered" in the 15th century (in 1431) by Gonçalo Velho Cabral a Captain in the service of Infante D. Henrique, though credit is also given to the explorer Diogo de Silves (in 1427). At some point, following the discovery of Santa Maria, sheep were let loose on the island before settlement actually took place. This was done to supply the future settlers with food because there were no large animals on the island. Settlement did not take place right away, however. There was not much interest among the Portuguese people in an isolated archipelago hundreds of miles from civilization. But patiently Cabral gathered resources and settlers for the next three years (1433–1436) and sailed to establish colonies on Santa Maria first and then later on São Miguel.',
'The Volta Simple (in Portuguese, the Simple Turn) was a nautical technique used by Portuguese sailors on their way to Central Africa, so they could return to Lisbon without having the wind currents against them. The Simple Volta was stablished after crossing the Cabo Bojador (in 1434), but it was known since the times of the first travellers to the Canary Islands. The technique involved making a large turn at sea, avoiding the Trade Winds until the ship reached a current that drived it directly to the area of Lisbon. Mastering this technique allowed the Portuguese to reach lands even more far off, and the evolution of this would enable them to reach the Cape, in South Africa, and even India, later in the early XVI century.',
'Fears of what lay beyond Cape Bojador, and whether it was possible to return once it was passed, were assuaged in 1434 when it was rounded by one of Prince Henry''s captains, Gil Eanes. Once this psychological barrier had been overcome, it became easier to probe further along the coast. In 1443 Prince Pedro, Henry''s brother, granted him the monopoly of navigation, war and trade in the lands south of Cape Bojador. Later this monopoly would be enforced by the Papal bulls Dum Diversas (1452) and Romanus Pontifex (1455), granting Portugal the trade monopoly for the newly discovered lands. Portuguese navigators reached ever more southerly latitudes, advancing at an average rate of one degree a year. Senegal and Cape Verde Peninsula were reached in 1445. The first feitoria trade post overseas was established in 1445 on the island of Arguin off the coast of Mauritania, to attract Muslim traders and monopolize the business in the routes traveled in North Africa. In 1446, António Fernandes pushed on almost as far as present-day Sierra Leone and the Gulf of Guinea was reached in the 1460s.',
'In the Middle Ages each province had a character of infrastructure, typically a region would specialist in agriculture or in a series of urban satellite settlements. Of course, this is not to say that a region with towns had no farmlands- only that the focus of development and government, as well as the predominant type of scoiety was centred around different ways of life. In many localities, rulers would give ''Town Charters'', ''City Charters'', form ''Royal Burghs'' or grant specific trading rights, laws and tax freedoms as well as tolls and customs depending on the type of commerce in a province. A region that produced a great deal of a single commodity such as wool for export could be taxed at a higher or lower rate depending on the control a ruler wanted to apply to his local businesses. In other aspects, a region could have a mainly agricultural focus which although grew more slowly than the population centres grouped into towns in time the benefits of a highly developed farming community could be a great asset to a realm. Agricultural areas were typically much more stratified than the bourgeois (city folk), since peasants served landlords in a pyramid system. Life for farmworkers was very tough and poverty could be extreme, serfs were basically slaves and in poor conditions, peasants would frequently revolt. However as manors and estates developed around the households of the landed gentry life improved, encouraged trade, business and pastoral culture deep in the heart of a province. Towns focussed the population which allowed the concentration of culture and crafts. Where people were amassed together in one place, traders and merchants were more likely to congregate because they knew they had buyers for their commerce. Similarly, craftsmen and artisans were also abundant in these urban sites. Taxation was much easier to apply since the population could be more easily controlled in a concentrated area. However, populations boomed where people lived in such close quarters of each other and health, hygiene and law could easily spiral out of control as these secondary settlements advanced.',
'Hamlets were small settlements which were dependant on farmlands and usually were run by the communities of the hamlets as a collective. Hamlets could also grow up around trading crossroads such as by a ford in a river or around a natural resource such as mines, quarries or hunting grounds. People generally considered themselves free from the oppression of landlords and were the beginnings of commercial centres.',
'Villages would attract traders and merchants from the provincial capital, establishing a network around the major city and into the countryside at these specific communities where population were more densely packed than in the open landscapes of farmlands. Villages allowed concentrated points where people would seek work, and come to buy and sell where they knew there was trade.',
'Secondary towns could spring up in a province as satellites around a regional capital. A wealthy province would have trade centres in an entire network, covering a variety of specialist trades. However grouping people into small concentrated population centres had its drawbacks, since health was an issue especially multiplied by growth rates, furthermore the merchants who had become a kind of urban nobility resented taxation -these burghers or bourgeois often themselves formed or funded the militias, and emerged to challenge the counts and dukes. Nonetheless the benefits of having concentrated populations was the ability to set and to extract taxes more efficiently- as long as the people could be properly governed and policed. Crime was a further issue in urban areas, towns would attract poor people and those who had no means to earn a wage in trade other than theft or prostitution.',
'Medieval cities were always walled settlements, these were naturally defensive structures but had the added bonus of keeping the population inside the walls! Policing and taxation as well as other forms of control were much easier when the lords and their men could look down on the streets from the walls. However, a city could easily grow quicker than its walls could expand. Typically secondary settlements such as small towns and villages which had grown up around manors or small farmsteads some distance outside of a major city could in fact find themselves merging with the city as it grew. A river port as a trade outlet to a city, for instance, could quickly find itself as part of the city itself, transformed from a small riverside town into wharfs and warehouses. City quarters outside of the city walls were usually considered dangerous places, both due to bad law and hygiene. Suburbs grew up organically out of shacks and slums, usually based on the foundations of old manorial estates. This was in contrast to the streets inside the city walls which were developed by design and set up in quarters where different social classes were designated. Sewerage and human waste was merely dumped in the streets in medieval times, rubbish and effluent would float along the streets out of the side gates and down into the ditches (a primitive sort of moat) outside the walls. The poorest burials sites were also near to the suburbs, usually mass graves. During times of pestilence or war, a city would shut its gates to the poorfolk outside of the walls. Nonetheless it was a sign of a prosperous city that so many were drawn from far afield to seek a living even in the slums, and taxation and trade was still possible here after all.',
'Serfs were no more than slaves, they were at the very bottom of the social ladder. The word serf is related to ''service'' and they were in the feudal system in direct service to the landlords. Forced labor of serfs were bound to a hereditary plot of land owned by a lord in return for protection and the right to work on fields they leased from their landlords to maintain their own subsistence. Serfdom involved not only work in owner''s fields, but his mines, forests and roads. A freeman became a serf usually through force or necessity. Sometimes freeholders or allodial owners were intimidated into dependency by the greater physical and legal force of a local baron. Often a few years of crop failure, a war or brigandage might leave a person unable to make his own way. In such a case a bargain was struck with the lord. In exchange for protection, service was required, in payment and/or with labour. The majority of the population existed in serfdom or peasantry, in 11th century England freemen made up only 10% of the population.',
'Peasants were a slightly higher social level than serfs, but they were still very poor with very few civil rights. This made them prone to rebellions, especially since they made up the majority of the population and in their view at least held the true power of a province. The word ''peasant'' has come to identify an entire culture, and their way of life is often typified as iconic of the Middle Ages. What we term ''peasants'' were actually often bordars: persons ranking below a villein and above a serf in the social hierarchy of a manor, holding just enough land to feed a family (about 5 acres or 2 hectares) and were required to provide labour on the demesne on specified days of the week.',
'Villeins had more rights and higher status than the lowest serf, but were under a number of legal restrictions that differentiated them from freemen. Villeins generally rented small homes, with or without land. As part of the contract with their landlord, they were expected to spend some of their time farming the lord''s fields. The rest of their time was spent farming their own land. Like other types of serfs, they were required to provide other services, possibly in addition to paying rent of money or goods, such as military service as levies or maintenance work on roads or building. Villeins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord''s consent. However, in other regards, they were free men in the eyes of the law, for villeins were generally able to have their own property, unlike slaves. In many medieval countries, a villein could theoretically gain freedom by escaping to a city and living there for more than a year; and this was in fact a common occurrence especially with the rise of urban centres. But this naturally involved the loss of land and agricultural livelihood and these villeins newly arrived in a city were normally unskilled workes with no trade or craftsmanship skills and therefore were more likely to take to crime for survival, which gave the alternate spelling "villain" its modern meaning.',
'Freeholdings, were land held by freemen. In Europe they made up no more than 10% of the entire population and that included the nobility. Most freemen were not nobles but were of the status of sergeants, who formed clans and had recognisable households. Sergeants and other freemen would usually make up the top ranks of tenant farmers but were in fact themselves subject to the regional and local lords such as barons, just as the barons were subject to counts and dukes, and they in turn were subjects to kings. For this reason sergeants were often given the latin gloss ''servientes'' or servants, which can be quite misleading. Freemen were on the whole a key segment of the feudal order whereby nobility and peasantry could be mediated and taxation, law as well as freedoms could be enacted. They were in many ways the original middle class.',
'Encouraging markets in a region is not difficult nor expensive, it only takes a little organisation and some financial sponsorship to draw in merchants who then take it upon themselves to exploit any local means of business, whether it be natural or human resources.',
'Investing funds into militias across the region is a good way to protect the peasants and villages across the landscape, they take it upon themselves to help their lords to defend and maintain military strength. It aids law and even taxation, allowing a free men to always be on standby.',
'Sponsoring fairs in the countryside and villages of a province brings less direct impact and income than a fair in a large town or regional capital- nonetheless the overall boost to commerce and happiness is worth it. Although banditry and disease are encouraged by the black market, movement of merchants and the exploitation of the weak for hard cash. -There''s always someone who has to ruin things for everyone else!',
'Serjeanty originated in the assignation of an estate in land on condition of the performance of a certain duty other than knight-service, usually the discharge of duties in the household of king or noble. It ranged from service in the king''s host, distinguished only by equipment from that of the knight, to petty renders scarcely distinguishable from those of the rent-paying tenant or socager. Serjeants (servientes) are already entered as a distinct class in Domesday Book (1086), though not in all cases differentiated from the barons, who held by knight-service. The majority of freeholders, squires and lesser gentry made up the sergeantry class, and they were entitled to bear their own arms at least in the early medieval period. As the concept of piety enlarged, the gap between baronial knights and free sergeants widened drastically, nonetheless they remained the backbone of most professional fighting forces and made up the bulk of the officers. Sergeantry combined with third level conscription allows European armies to recruit soldiers of the sergeant class.',
'Knights were generally of the baronial class, each man held an estate in feudal service to a lord which had military, judicial and economic duties.Tenure by barony was the higher feudal tenure of a lord who had subordinate knights. Originally, a barony was the land subject to a baron and could, in England after the Norman Conquest, consist of estates scattered throughout the country or in several regions (see, for example, the barony of the earl of Pembroke, with estates in England, Ireland, and Normandy). A medieval barony might comprise more than one manor or fief, and the principal manor often had a minor castle, however a barony constituted an administrative division of a country, of lower rank and importance than a county -barons were subject to the counts and dukes of the aristocracy. Combined with the fourth level of conscription this allows European armies to recruit knights and other soldiers from the higher levels of society.',

'Nobly-owned great estates (sometimes called latifundia).',
'Each estate was divided into smaller productive units known as massarie and mandre, specializing respectively in the commercialized production of bread cereals (mainly wheat) and the raising of cattle. These units were generally leased for one to three years to the petty nobility in nearby towns (notaries, merchants, physicians, tax farmers etc...) who either managed the farms directly or sub-let them to others.',
'Sicilian feudalism meets Italian capitalism, merchants loaned cash directly to the massari and were repaid with grain at a price that included interest on the loan.',
'Baronial extortion, an invented fee demanded by seigneurs over the people in their lands. This was mainly exacted in the highlands where barons could get away with local corruption without investigation and punishment. They were even known to hold government officials to ransom in this manner. The Crown condemned this practice with a fine of 1 million florins which despite inflation meant that effectually gave the right for the Crown to confiscate baronial property and assets. This led to Giovanni Chiaromonte’s revolt in 1325.',
'A form of Sicilian Domesday Book it was an investigation and estimation of the taxation due to the Crown from the various properties in Sicily. What was difficult however was ascertaining which estates belonged to which lords. The changeable monarchy in Sicily from Hauteville to Angevin to Hohenstaufen all had effects on the populace in that the only stability was a local power, a local law, and a local conflict with one’s neighbours over land rights and wealth.',
'Royal convent, such as the one received by Dominican brothers on the way to the Holy Land who were given property at Trapani by King Frederick (1296-1337). This was naturally not mere charity but a political move whereby the monks became royal chaplains and confessors, as part of the impressive religious zealotry that effected Sicily in the early 1300s. This evangelism was in fact a mean by which the barons escaped confiscation or taxation of their lands by the Crown by appearing to give portions of their territory to monasteries such as Dominicans and Fransiscans who conveniently rejected worldly goods, possessions and wealth- unlike the Church in Rome with its priests, bishops and the corrupt Pope. By ‘investing’ in such money-laundering the barons were able to rent out their lands. Nonetheless the overall effect of these private churches and monasteries meant that the Sicilian state had a growing independence from the Church in Rome and vehemently opposed its imperialist colonisation and the politics of its legates and bishops.',
'Rejection of ecclesiastical priveledges and jurisdictional power of the Papacy. During the reign of Frederick II, the growing imperialism of the Papacy was widely considered to be one of the greatest enemies of the new nationalism of the state of Sicily. It was a strange state of affairs, the king was able to inspire religious fervour at the same as pushing the Papal agents and officers out of the country- by force! The assets and estates of the bishops and monasteries were seized and redistributed to nobles, villages, or clergy of the state''s choosing. Several serious political incidents occurred in this aggressive coup de etat, often involving small skirmishes between bandits who took advantage of the retreating Papists, as well as scraps between episcopal retinues and state militias.',
'Constitutiones regalis, capitula alia and Ordinationes generales were massive state reforms introduced by Frederick III of Sicily in the period 1296-1337. This was created to the background of Sicily''s great nationalisation- it''s staunch resistance to Papal colonisation and to Angevin assumption of the so-called Kingdom of Naples, Sicily''s mainland territories. Frederick himself was beset by all the challenges a medieval monarch could face, and it would have been understandable that his people overthrew him in anger at Sicily''s foreign policy. On the contrary Frederick managed to endear the populace to him and leave behind a powerful and independent state to his son. All of this was aided by the foundation of the Constitution, way ahead of its time this set of laws gave a written set of foundational laws by which the king and the people had both responsibilities and statutory limitations on their power. Still firmly rooted in feudalism the Constitution defined the monarchy as responsible for defence and overall administration of the kingdom, whilst acknowledging that both war and peace could not be made without the express permission of parliament. Furthermore it laid out clear boundaries for the powers of the High Court which would audit the nobility as well as giving full rights to the lower classes.',

'In order for a region to have the full infrastructure to re-equip and maintain a large military force with armour, swords or even shoe hundreds of warhorses and packhorses on a regular basis- there needed to be a simpler basic foundation. Without proper access to more civil trades such as forestry- there could be no blacksmithing. Forestry was only one of the crafts that was needed to support more developed military logistics. Foresters would not only select, cultivate and shape wood for use in weapons such as spears and warmachines but also for making the buildings that would be used for firepits and furnaces that blacksmiths would need. Foresters would also constantly deliver charcoal, created via a highly skilled and patient process of smouldering wood in a confined container. Charcoal was the primary fuel used in forges that blacksmiths used to maintain and even, steady temperature in the fire to allow him to form his ironwork. Once the basic trades, crafts and merchants were in place- then the development of military support could begin.',

'Parliaments in the Crown of Aragon were esteemed assemblies, they were a representation of the Aragonese, Catalonian and Valencian establishments, which formed diferent "branches" of the Court that were obliged to assist the government through their representatives. At first they were only gathered by the King, but from 1283 it was obligatory for the King to gather them (every year in Aragon, every three years in Catalonia and Valencia). The main councillors who were present at the courts were voted for by the constituency, and each city and village sent representatives to the court too. ',
'This book gathered the laws and conditions of the seafaring in this port''s waters, and its most famous example is found in Barcelona. The full title in Catalan is Les costums marítimes de Barcelona universalment conegudes per Llibre del Consolat de mar, or "The maritime customs of Barcelona universally known as the Book of the Consulate of the Sea". The earliest extant printed edition of the work (Barcelona, 1494) is without a title-page or frontispiece, but it is described by the above-mentioned title in the epistle dedicatory prefixed to the table of contents. The only known copy of this edition (as of 1911) is preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. The epistle dedicatory states that the work is an amended version of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea, compiled by Francis Celelles with the assistance of numerous shipmasters and merchants well versed in maritime affairs.',
'The Catalan institution can be traced to the grant of the Carta Consular to the city of Barcelona by James I of Aragon in 1258. This gave Barcelona merchants the right to settle their commercial disputes without interference from the royal courts: in return, the king received much needed financial support for his wars of expansion. Mercantile Law (ius mercadorium) was becoming established at the same time through much of Europe, and similar bodies had already been established in Messina (first third of the 13th century) and Genoa (1250). As the territories of the Crown of Aragon expanded, it was customary to establish new Consulates of the Sea in the major ports. One of the earliest was in Valencia (1283), where the charter of Peter I of Aragon makes it clear that disputes are to be settled "according to maritime customs, as these are accepted in Barcelona."',

'Historically, the deputation appeared at first in Catalonia, where it was called Generalitat. Soon, the Aragonese and the Valencians followed this model.

'The improvement and construction of cañadas will able the shepherds to move with more security and order from one corner to other of the province, thus allowing the creation of a better net of roads and an improvement of the catlle explotation. There is an ancient tradition in the peninsula of raising livestock in open fields, as evidenced by classical Roman references and archaeological remains such as the Bulls of Guisando. Free range horse and cattle herding would later be brought to the Americas and would especialize as Gaucho and Cowboy practices altogether with a rich social culture of their own with stockbreeding mainly for meat and leather rather than milk, though this may not be totally unexploited. The exploitation of large herds of pigs and sheep in transhumant style was established by the early Middle Ages, if not earlier, as evidenced by highly-regulated laws in documents of the Mesta. It may have a longer history based in classical methods developed through an earlier politically and legally unified peninsula during the lower Roman Empire: some Visigothic records indicate continuity. Drovers'' roads continue to exist, including a well-known one through Madrid. Some bee-keepers work in transhumant style in Spain.',
'In early Middle Ages periodical gatherings of the shepherds and stockbreeders of a local community were probably common, gathering twice or three times a year to care of their cattle''s grazing in the mesta or pasture and to apply local laws to decide about the lost cattles. Soon, some of those councils or gatherings started to join themselves in brotherhoods of shepherds and stockbreeders, which were in charge of the regulation of their pastures. This "juntas" gathered more and more local communities, forming "mestas" (in Castille) and "ligallos" (in Aragon).',
'The mestas, councils of shepherding and stockbreeder communities, were in charge of the lost cattle (which should be returned to its master, and if not, sold), fixed the arguments and disputes between stockbreeders, and decided about all the matters related to the breeding, the care and the vigilance of the cattle, for what they enacted laws. In the kingdom of Castillle and Leon those institutions developed a lot in the XII century, forming "mestas" in Leon, Soria, Segovia, and Cuenca.',
'The Spanish Honrado Concejo de la Mesta (Honored Council of the Mesta) was a powerful association of sheep holders in the medieval Kingdom of Castile, formed by all the stockbreeders and mestas of the Kingdom. Alfonso X the Wise granted them privileges in 1273. The sheep were transhumant, migrating from the pastures of Extremadura and Andalusia to Castile and back according to the season. The no-mans-land (up to 100 km across) between Christian Spain and Moorish Spain was too insecure for arable farming and was only exploited by shepherds. When the land was reconquered by the Spanish, farmers began to settle and disputes with pastoralists were common. The Mesta can be regarded as the first, and most powerful, agricultural union in medieval Europe. The exportation of merino wool enriched the Mesta members (nobility and church orders) who had acquired ranches during the process of Reconquista.The kings of Castile conceded many privileges to the Mesta. Even today, herds of sheep may be transported by rail, but the perhaps prehistoric cañadas (traditional rights-of-ways for sheep) are legally protected "forever" from occupation and barring. Some Madrid streets are still part of the cañada system, and there are groups that organize sheep transportation across the modern city as a reminder of ancient rights and cultures.',

'The concept of the Public Palace or City Hall was to define the state''s political leadership not by a single governor such as a Duke, but by a republic. The Noble Houses or signoria were of course the real holders of power in medieval Italy, from their ranks came all the great leaders but it was also the conspiratorial intrigues of the polticians who usually brought down these leaders too.\n\nThe whole affair was much like Roman politics, there was the senate and those ambitious men who would rise from their ranks to become dictator. The Palazzo Pubblico was typically led by a council and at the head a designated chairman or captain, such as a Podesta or Capitano del Populo. This leader would vary in his means to actively rule directly over the state depending on his personal strength of character.\n\nThe republic was on the surface an oligarchy but organic monarchs could rise within this frame just as nobles could constrict the power of a Duke. The Republic spreads power more evenly than a Duchy however, although conversely this can just empower more nobles. The Campanile or ''bell tower'' was a central feature of a Palace, used for telling the time and calling the people to newsreadings, emergencies and legal executions. The palace was the head of the city and its politics, home to all the offices of administration, the military, law courts, tax and trade bureacracies as well as the nest of conspiracies and plots.',
'Capitulo or Commune, and Gran signoria',
'A Palazzo Ducale, or Duke’s Palace, was once a traditional seat and title, however with the waning of the Empire in Italy and the rise of the merchant-nobles, towards the high and late Middle Ages, Duchies returned but in a new more ''modern'' form. As well as being the home of the Duke or Doge (often an elected rather than inherited title) it was the venue for the state law courts, its civil administration and bureaucracy. It would house the core of the faction nobility, serve as the headquarters for the military and even hold the city jail.\n\nThe majority of the Italian states were reformed in the Middle Ages as republics, and often guarded fiercely against hereditary rule, though that principle was increasingly shaped to the advantage of the ruling classes.\n\nA well-entrenched bureaucracy of elected civil servants, committees and councils was presided over by the Duke who as faction leader was a de facto monarch or ''prince''. The Duke participated in several of the republican committees and thus played a huge role in steering policy. The state''s principle of ''rule for life'' was an attempt to establish stability, an experienced strategy based on statecraft avoiding the whims of temporarily elected officials.\n\nBut in order to check the corruptions of lifetime rule the nobles ran a complex system to parallel and counter the Duke''s court. For instance, all his mail was read first by the censor and all foreign dignitaries were received in committee rather than by the Duke alone. So although there was support for a powerful centralised state led by a single focussed ruler, this power varied based on the innate personal strength of the character concerned and how he acted in the context of his rivals.',

'Most Templars came from aristocratic backgrounds, even the sergentry class were not mere peasants but upper middle class landowners who were trained in combat from birth. When they joined the Order, they turned over a good part of their private wealth to the Order. Even sympathetic lords and laymen made vast donations becoming Donati, often serving with the Order in battle for short periods to ensure their penance was done. What this meant was that the Temple was sitting on vast reserves of land and bullion by the thirteenth century. Their hundreds of thick-walled preceptories were not just places of worship but banks as well. This sprawling network of preceptories across Europe and the Middle East allowed the Order to offer a way for people to become more mobile without fear of losing their wealth. The Templars were founded orginally to guard pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land, only later becoming the ''divine wrath''. The system of investment with the Order grew organically out of this fundamental raison d''etre. Pilgrims, penitents, and crusaders deposited physical wealth and land deeds with the Order to save them from carrying around actual cash. These ''clients'' would then make withdrawals from another preceptory, for instance once they reached the Holy Land, and this was subject to interest. In the common event of the client''s death, the Order acted as clerks and executors of the Will, again taking their own cut for their services. The added bonus of dealing with the preceptories was that you knew you were leaving your money in a heavily guarded place. Interest and capital banking soon became the very fuel that drove the Order, making them welcome tennants to most of Europe not just along the pilgrimage routes. In turn the Templars became so rich as a military organisation that they were effectively the Pope''s personal army of elites. However, investment banking called ''usury'' in the Middle Ages was totally illegal and contrary to Christian law. It was for this reason that Jews were among the few allowed to work as bankers. The Church overlooked the Templar usuries, as it grew slowly out of the pilgrims'' safety deposit system and the Pope quickly saw the effectiveness of this commerce. It was argued that usury was against God''s law but since the Templars were acting for God they were not taking interest for themselves but for Holy purposes and the Crusades. However, the Order by virtue of being the very few legal bankers in Christendom were able to charge extortionate interest rates- much higher than the Jewish bankers- around 60%. This naturally made them very powerful and since they had the ability to physically enforce their forfeits they found that the royal families of Europe were becoming heavily indebted to the Order. This led to political conspiracies, much like the animosity and seizure of assets targetted against the Jews. Eventually, with the abetting of the Pope, the French King was able to frame the entire Order overnight for heresy and all their vast wealth was confiscated and divided up. Many of the Templars were burnt at the stake, some managed to escape to Portugal where they founded a new Order called the Knights of Christ.',

'While the Perfecti pledged themselves to ascetic lives of simplicity, frugality and purity, Cathar credentes (believers) were not expected to adopt the same stringent lifestyle. They were, however, expected to refrain from eating meat and dairy products, from killing and from swearing oaths. Catharism was above all a populist religion and the numbers of those who considered themselves "believers" in the late 12th century included a sizeable portion of the population of Languedoc, counting among them many noble families and courts. These individuals often drank, ate meat, and led relatively normal lives within medieval society—in contrast to the Perfecti, whom they honoured as exemplars. Though unable to embrace the life of chastity, the credentes looked toward an eventual time when this would be their calling and path.',
'Perfect (also known as a Parfait in French or Perfecti in Latin) was the name given to a monk of the medieval French Christian religious movement commonly referred to as the Cathars. They were expected to follow a lifestyle of extreme renunciation and austerity from the world which included abstaining from eating meat and avoiding all sexual contact. By that virtue they were recognized as trans-material (i.e. spiritualized) angels by their followers, the Credentes (Croyant in French, Believers in English). Perfectii were drawn from all walks of life and counted aristocrats, merchants and peasants among their number. Women could also become Perfects; Female Perfects were known as Parfaites or Perfectae.One of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum (Consolation) to the dying - this ensured admittance of the soul of the deceased to heaven and normally required a request from the recipient to a Perfect for the Consolamentum - this meant that many Perfects would not administer the Consolamentum to those who were beyond reason or sentient speech - as they clearly were not in a position to make the necessary request. One of the conditions of being a Credente was the uttering of the Convanenza, or Covenant, when encountering a Perfect, which involved the request for the Consolamentum should they be dying. This was aimed at enabling the Perfect to bestow the sacrament to those whose illness meant they could not ask for it. The Cathars believed in a doctrine of reincarnation interpreting the idea of Eternal Life promised in the Bible as meaning release from the cycle of successive births in this world, which they believed to be ruled over by Satan. The Consolamentum was thought to purify the soul through the Holy Spirit before death to enable its ascent to Christ. Naturally it was this priesthood, so widespread throughout France, the Low Countries and northern Italy as well as the Bogomil homelands of Thrace that were so heavily persecuted by the conventional Churches of Catholicism and Orthodoxy.',
'An individual entered into the community of Perfecti through a ritual known as the consolamentum, a rite that was both sacramental and sacerdotal in nature: sacramental in that it granted redemption and liberation from this world; sacerdotal in that those who had received this rite functioned in some ways as the Cathar clergy—though the idea of priesthood was explicitly rejected. The consolamentum was the baptism of the Holy Spirit, baptismal regeneration, absolution, and ordination all in one. The ritual consisted of the laying on of hands (and the transfer of the spirit) in a manner believed to have been passed down in unbroken succession from Jesus Christ. Upon reception of the consolamentum, the new Perfectus surrendered his or her worldly goods to the community, vested himself in a simple black or blue robe with cord belt, and sought to undertake a life dedicated to following the example of Christ and his Apostles — an often peripatetic life devoted to purity, prayer, preaching and charitable work. Above all, the Perfecti were dedicated to enabling others to find the road that led from the dark land ruled by the dark lord, to the realm of light which they believed to be humankind''s first source and ultimate end.',
'The term Pays Cathare, French meaning "Cathar Country" is used to highlight the Cathar heritage and history of the region where Catharism was traditionally strongest. Only though a modern term it does have some value as a reference to those homelands of Albigensian Catharism which was so successfual and popular not only in creating its own population of believers but being accepted by its neighbours who particularly in the case of the catholic population Toulouse were ready to fight and die -even as Catholics- to protect these men and women who were called Bons Chretiens: ''Good Christians''.',
'Cathar castles (in French Châteaux cathares) is a modern term used to designate a series of fortresses built by the French king on the southern border of his lands at the end of the Albigensian Crusade. Some of these sites, before the royal period, were fortified villages capable of sheltering Cathars and which were destroyed during the building of citadels. In Languedoc, the only real "Cathar castles" were fortified homesteads (castrum), such as Laurac, Fanjeaux, Mas-Saintes-Puelles. Certain sites like Lastours-Cabaret, Montségur, Termes or Puilaurens were castra before being razed to the ground and becoming royal citadels. The legend of Cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth. The only monuments which witnessed the events of the first half of the 13th century, and therefore the only ones which can claim the description "Cathar", given that the Cathar Church never built anything, are the small castles. Therefore the majority of castles given over to the Cathars- inkeeping with their largely pacifist faith were purely defensive structures where the last vestiges of persecuted ''heretics'' fled from the Catholics. Although the loss in territory to this religious minority involved a loss of land, it did in fact stabilise the outlying regions and enable a form local autonomies that would defend themselves independently from Albigensian Crusaders.',
'The Inquisition was established in 1229 to uproot the remaining Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, Carcassonne and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it finally succeeded in extirpating the movement. Cathars who refused to recant were hanged, or burnt at the stake. From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of Montségur was besieged by the troops of the seneschal of Carcassonne and the archbishop of Narbonne. On 16 March 1244, a large and symbolically important massacre took place, where over 200 Cathar perfects were burnt in an enormous fire at the prat des cramats near the foot of the castle. Moreover, the Church decreed lesser chastisements against laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars, at the 1235 Council of Narbonne. Inquisitors required heretical sympathisers - repentant first offenders - to sew a yellow cross onto their clothes. A popular though as yet unsubstantiated theory holds that a small party of Cathar perfects escaped from the fortress before the massacre at prat des cramats. It is widely held in the Cathar region to this day that the escapees took with them Le Tresor Cathar. What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars'' accumulated wealth made up of the sizeable donations of the converted nobility of the area as well as any property of those that became Perfecti. This ''treasure'' whether material or literary was quite arguably the very impetus that continued to drive the survival of Catharism throughout Europe well into the late Middle Ages where they were seen in the riots and persecutions in as far afield as Russia, the Low Countries and Spain.',

'Usury from Medieval Latin usuria, "interest", or from Latin usura, "interest" originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as investment and capital. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. The term is largely derived from Christian religious principles; Riba is the corresponding Arabic term and ribbit is the Hebrew word. The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury (canon 17). At the time, usury was interest of any kind, and the canon merely forbade the clergy to lend money on interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% APR). Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity. The Third Lateran Council decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor Christian burial. Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury a heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation which allowed it. Pope Sixtus V condemned the practice of charging interest as "detestable to God and man, damned by the sacred canons and contrary to Christian charity." All of this however, had absolutely no application to Jews. The Torah makes a distinction between interest deducted before the loan is handed over and interest deducted afterwards. What is clear – as with so much of the Old Testament – is that many prohibitions applied within the Jewish community did not apply outside. In other words, there was a loophole allowing interest to be charged to gentiles. Nonetheless Talmudic Law confined Jewish interest rates to 20%. With the rise of Templar banking and Italian banking who both had comparatively astronomical interest rates (possibly due to the social constrictions which they had found loopholes through) Jewish banking remained extremely popular due to its fairness. As the Jews were ostracized from most professions by local rulers, the church and the guilds, they were pushed into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending. Natural tensions between creditors and debtors were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Precisely in the same way that the aristoricies and European royal families found themselves indebted to the Templars and thereby conspired their demise, so Jews were pushed out of Europe. In 1275, Edward I of England passed the Statute of Jewry which made usury illegal and linked it to blasphemy, in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to the Crown. In 1290, all Jews were expelled from England, and allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown''s. The usury was cited as the official reason for the Edict of Expulsion. The violence targetted at Jews increased in Europe, no doubt encouraged by the indebted aristocracy. In time Italian bankers won the financial war and their way of doing business transformed European commerce, dragging Europe into the Renaissance.',
'The "Constitution for the Jews" was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first bill was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II, intended to protect Jews who suffered during the First Crusade, and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century. The bill forbade, besides other things, Christians from forcing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication. Rather than being specifically targetted at treatment of Jews in Judea, it was more practically focussed on the Jewish communities in Eruope. Jewish merchants and bankers were the lifeblood of European business and ''usury'' or investment banking was reserved solely for Jews. In an attempt to entice more Jews into Europe, with the lure that they were constitutionally protected by religious law- the Pope took this official stance. However as was seen on so many occassions with the terrible violence and blood libels targetted on the Jewish community, this Constitution was in time proven an empty promise.',
'Benedictine refers to the spirituality and consecrated life in accordance with the Rule of St Benedict, written by Benedict of Nursia in the sixth century for the cenobitic communities he founded in central Italy. The most notable of these is Monte Cassino, the first monastery founded by Benedict around 529. Once a postulant has formally entered a monastery he must stay there until he dies. All monks must take turns working in the kitchens and waiting at table. Monks must remain busy, either with manual work, restoring manuscripts or in study and prayer. Monks must remain silent unless they have to speak. The Abbot must be a father to his community. The Abbot must hold meetings with all the monks to decide monastery business. The Abbot''s orders must be obeyed without argument. Every monk must take a vow of chastity. No one should own anything. Monks must pray together seven times a day. At every meal, there must be a reading from the bible. Great care must be taken of those who are sick. The large tracts of land needed to support these communities often meant that the lord who had donated his land to the Order would have to make most use of the rest of his domains by intensifying serfdom and condensing his local population onto smaller patches of land. The poor provincials in the vicinity of the monasteries in any case benefitted from the religous services they performed as wewll as the medical care they offered the communities. The monks also served as clerks and adminstrators for the local landowners and also provided cultural submissions such as art and literature, often focussing on the recording and collection of histories.',
'The word abbot meaning father, is a title given to the head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is Abbess. Monasticism in the West owes its extension and development to Benedict of Nursia (born AD 480). His rule was diffused with miraculous rapidity from the parent foundation on Monte Cassino through the whole of western Europe, and every country witnessed the erection of monasteries far exceeding anything that had yet been seen in spaciousness and splendour. Few great towns in Italy were without their Benedictine convent, and they quickly rose in all the great centres of population in England, France and Spain. The number of these monasteries founded between AD 520 and 700 is amazing. Before the Council of Constance, AD 1415, no fewer than 15,070 abbeys had been established of this order alone. The buildings of a Benedictine abbey were uniformly arranged after one plan, modified where necessary (as at Durham and Worcester, where the monasteries stand close to the steep bank of a river) to accommodate the arrangement to local circumstances. In the high Middle Ages, some abbots even claimed supremacy over bishops an actually took on the mantle of episcopal regalia and insignia. When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop''s diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot''s journey to Rome. ',
'In the heyday of the monastic schools in the 9th and 10th centuries, the teachings of important scholars such as Alcuin, Hrabanus Maurus, Heiric of Auxerre and Notker Balbulus raised the prestige of their abbeys and attracted pupils from afar to attend their courses. Although some monastic schools contributed to the emerging medieval universities, the rise of the universities did not go unchallenged. Some monastic figures such as Bernard of Clairvaux considered the search for knowledge using the techniques of scholasticism to be a challenge to the monastic ideal of simplicity. The rise of medieval universities and scholasticism in the Renaissance of the 12th century offered alternative venues and new learning opportunities to the students and thus led to a gradual decline of the monastic schools.',
'The term Cistercian (French Cistercien), derives from Cistercium, the Latin name for the village of Cîteaux, near Dijon in eastern France. It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded Cîteaux Abbey in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict. The best known of them were Robert of Molesme, Alberic of Citeaux and the English monk Stephen Harding, who were the first three abbots. Bernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order. By the end of the 12th century, the order had spread throughout France and into England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Eastern Europe. The most striking feature of the Order was the return to manual labour, especially field-work, a special characteristic of Cistercian life. Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture. Additionally, in relation to fields such as agriculture, hydraulic engineering and metallurgy, the Cistercians became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. The monasteries despite usually being situated in very inhospitable terrain, were granted better land in time from religious aristocrats. This took land away from the commoners, however their addition to the culture of provincial life and benefits that were arguably worth it.',
'The Mendicant Orders were religious orders which depended directly on the charity of the people for their livelihood. In principle, they rejected owned property, either individually or collectively, believing that this was the most pure way of life to copy followed by Jesus Christ, in order that all their time and energy could be expended on religious work. Since they did not take up massive tracts of farmlands to support themselves they were widely accepted by the local communities they interacted with. They were able to offer medical support and were key members of daily life, officiating birth, marriage and death rites as well as carrying services each week and on all the many Catholic feast days. The Orders included were -Franciscans (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209. Carmelites, (Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206–1214. Dominicans (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215. Servites (Order of Servants of Mary), founded 1233 by the Seven Holy Men of Florence, Italy. Augustinians (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars), founded 1244 - 1256. The Second Council of Lyons (1274) recognized these as the five "great" mendicant orders, and suppressed certain others. The Council of Trent loosened their property restrictions. Afterwards, except for the Franciscans and their offshoot the Capuchins, members of the orders were permitted to own property collectively as do monks. Among other orders are the Trinitarians (Order of the Most Blessed Trinity), founded 1193. Mercedarians (Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy), founded 1218. Minims (Hermits of St. Francis of Paola), founded 1436',

'The Venetian Concione was basically what other Italian states called an Arengo, a public assembly. As a unique instituion however, it was one of the supreme fundamental offices of the Republic. The word developed in Italian to mean a ''tedious speech'' or a ''harangue'' -such were the goings-on of this primitive parliament. It was formed as far back as 742 and was the earliest republican council within the Kingdom of Italy, and was a forerunner of the 11th century Italian communesas they broke away from Imperial rule. It was this most basic instituion accepted by the Emperor from such an ealy stage that gave power to both the Republic and the democratic vote for each Dogate.',
'Founded in 1143, the Greater Assembly was adevelopment from the Concione. It convened in the Doge''s Palace and it''s members were chosen directly by the Doge. Participation was a hereditary and exclusive right of the Patrizie families enrolled in the so-called ''Book of Gold'' of the Veneziana nobility. In communal form of the State, with the birth of the Commune Veneciarum (" Municipality of Venezia").',
'Also called the Consiglio dei Saggi, or Council of Sages (wise men). In 1172 the Consilium was transformed into a sovereign assembly with the name of Greater Council or Maggior Consiglio, initially composed from 35 and later 100 councillors, which they joined by right of vote, from 1178.',
'The Minor Council was one of the constitutional organs of the Republic of Venice formed in 1175. It was composed of 6 councillors to the Doge. The Minor Council was therefore also called Council Ducale or Consiglio of the Six. The 6 Ducal Councillors, were elected and represented each of the 6 Sestiere (quarter) of the city. They served in office for 8 months, which could be renewed twice and they were not legible within two years of prior service. The Doge could only receive personal correspondence, give poltical audience or debate in the presence at least 4 Councillors. The most senior councillo had the function of vice-doge, in absence of the Most Serene Prince, the Doge himself. The Minor Council, despite its size was extremely powerful and in the face of the later centralisation and following decentralisation of the state, the fundamemntal democratic system of the office maintained the Dogate within legal regulations safeguarding against corruption and the exertion of monarchic authority.',
'The Council of the Forty or Supreme Court of the Quarantia also known simply as the Quarantia was one of the most important constitutional organs of the Republic of Venice, with a main function as forming and regulating legislative policies of a Supreme Court or Tribunal. It was a decisive weapon within the republican democratic state to regulate and control the issue of patrician power, corruption and potential threats to state secruity. Institued in 1179 it was a serious move from the Ducal monarchy of a city-state into a wider commune with constituent foreign colonies. The Forty were chosen by the Concione and enabled more lowly citizens- those who were not representatives of the noble merchant houses to authority governement, pass bills and enforce the rights of the Republic. After the constitutional reform of 1297 the so-called ''Lock out'' of the Greater Council, it changed the form of the State into aristocratic oligarchy. The Quarantia was then re-ordered, and its seats were nominationed from within the Greater Council, it was also answerable to the Council of the Pregadi vastly undermining its initial vision.',
'The Serene Council represented Venice''s glory days. It formed a centralised office of authority around the Doge, who served as the formal sovereign, six Ducal councillors elected from the Great Council by the members of the Minor Council and finally the Three Heads of the Quarantia, supreme judges.',
'The Council of the Pregadi (or Priviledged) was a final move in the Republican reforms of the centralised state of Venice. It was an attempt to create an ever more elite Senate, which overruled all the others- a form of House of Lords amongst the Patricians. Formed in 1229 it was a deliberately advanced assembly of the Republic, focussed on Venice''s new role as a superpower and specifically tasked itself with foreign politics. The Doge was naturally the supreme head of the Senate, but it received its members on annual election from the Grand Council. The Senate allowed its members to wear the red robes of office in contrast to the black of the other Patricians in the lower councils. It was responsible for the direct regulation of Venice''s overseas ambassadors and diplomats, and contained the military offices of the Capitan del Golfo, Capitan General da Mar and Capitan General de Teraferma.',

'The word ''limes'' was utilized by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier.

'Civitas Finitima was a fontier settlement. These regional capitals were considered fairly dangerous places since enemies, either military, political, cultural or economic were beyond the very close boundary of the ''empire'' or faction. Nonethless it was exactly for this reason that populations quickly swelled into these areas where trade and commerce was seen as a worthwhile endeavour and poorer people or those wishing to escape oppression and indentured service in the homelands could establish new lands and farmsteads in the colonies- typically using the old population as serfs or slaves.',
'To accept a province as a vassal, was to recognise its status as part of the realm and usually given to a specific governor. Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus "servant", a term used as part of feudalism in medieval Europe, where one enters into mutual obligations to a monarch, usually in the form of military support and mutual protection, in exchange for certain privileges, usually to include land held as a fiefdom.

'A commendation ceremony (commendatio) is a formal ceremony that evolved during the Early Medieval period to create a bond between a lord and his fighting man, called his vassal (Latin vassus).

The lord''s "servant" (vassus) might be born unfree, but the commendatio freed him. When two men entered into a feudal relationship, they underwent a ceremony known as commendation ceremony. The purpose of the commendation was to make a chosen person a vassal of a lord.',

Not only land but anything of value could be held in fief, such as an office, a right of exploitation (e.g., hunting, fishing) or any other type of revenue, rather than the land it comes from.',

'Its nine members, the Priori, were chosen from the ranks of the guilds of the city: six of them from the major guilds, and two from the minor guilds. The ninth became the Gonfaloniere of Justice. The names of all guild members over thirty years old were put in eight leather bags called borse.',
'In undertaking their governmental duties, the Signoria was required to consult two other elected councils collectively known as Collegi. The first was the Dodici Buonomini, with twelve members these ''good men'' served as a form of parliament. The four city Quartieri, quarters, by which Florens was partitioned would four times a year chose 3 men (I dodici Buonomini), vwith a mandate period of 3 months. 9 of the Good Men were from the greater merchant guilds Arti maggiori and an additional three were from the lesser Arti minori.',
'In undertaking their governmental duties, the Signoria was required to consult two other elected councils collectively known as Collegi. The second of these was the Collegio dei Sedici Gonfaloniere, a ''College'' of Sixteen city ''standard-bearers''. Each of the four city-quarters had four banner-bearers representing the actual quarter rather than the clans and merchant houses from those quarters themselves. These ''sesti'' were often also sports teams, and had as symbols on their banners- golden lions, rhions, eagle or dragons.',
'The Council of the Eight of War was usually a temporary formation, and specifically focussed on leading a military campaign. They were most famous during the Conflict with the Avignon Papacy where the war was named after them ''War of the Eight Saints''. These men were highly regarded with their trustworthiness. 2 were chosen from the lesser and major guilds respectively and four from the most powerful of the Famiglia houses.',
'Similar to the warcouncil of Eight, this was a temporary formation for emergency civil supervision, usually working in tandem with the war council. Actually formed of clerics loyal to the Signoria, and usually themselves members of the major Famiglia. The council would raise taxes and specifically target religious institutions. During the War of the Eight Saints they managed to bribe the English Condottiero John Hawkwood from his employment in Papal service with a sum well over 130,000 florins, three years later the settlement and truce to the war paid the Papacy 200,000 florins. Ironically in both cases the massive sums were culled from seizing all Church taxes (usually a tenth of all regional income) as well as raiding some monasteries and sites, taking land or gold from the altars.',
'This Council of the Eight was an extension of the temporrary war council, and a more longstanding group who were repsonsible for continued garrisoning and defence forces, as well as state security and police. The Balia were democratically chosen by lots, and used the Il libro dello Specchio register of taxation to screen candidates so that no financially indebted families would be eligible since personal finances were a factor. Furthermore the ''regime'' il Reggimento was to eliminate unpopular famiglia and merchant houses, often non-Florentine ''colonists'' who had branches in the city by setting extreme taxes which they simply could not pay- the merchant company had its assets seized and was forcibly evicted from the city.',
'One of the older palaces upon which the Palazzo Vecchio was built in 1299, the Palace of Infantry was a purely regimental headquarters and naturally formed a primarily defensive corps made of militia. It was extremely effective in running the expensive standing military companies. When the Vecchio was built it was an office incorporated into the new structure.',
'One of the older palaces upon which the Palazzo Vecchio was built in 1299, the Palace of the Executor of Justice was a major judicial office. It was extremely effective in maintaining strict control over the financial goings-on within the different merchant Houses and guilds. The office had full access and partial rights to edit the the Il libro dello Specchio register of taxation. When the Vecchio was built it was an office incorporated into the new structure.',
'The Palazzo dei Priori evolved into the Palazzo della Signoria, the Priori itself were the Guild-collective and council in fact made up of Signoria. It was also known as Palazzo Vecchio (Old Palace) Palazzo del Popolo and Palazzo Ducale depending on the exact form of government at the time. Immediately after the Signoria representatives were elected into their respective Collegi, they were expected to move into the Palazzo della Signoria, where they would remain for the two months of their office.',

'Each Curatoriae is led by a curator; who like a mayor would rule the trade, tax, law, construction, and levy system within each zone.',
'Like the curatorships upon which they were modelled, a giudicato had formally power over law, trade and tax and this extended to military control also.',
'Run by a consul of a republic, these states were so powerful that they were principalities in their own right.',
'Corporazioni delle arti e mestieri were the ''guilds of the artisans'', which in the Italian republics were the foundation of free commerce and the power houses of the merchant class. They were secular corporations that controlled the arts and trades in cities such as Florence and Milan and dominated southern European politics from the twelfth century. These Arti included seven major guilds (collectively known as the arti maggiori), five middle guilds (arti mediane) and nine minor guilds (arti minori). Their rigorous quality control and the political role in the commune that the Art Maggiori assumed were formative for their respective republics.',
'The Arti Minori were the so-called ''lesser guilds'' which were made up of tradesmen connected with the agricultural sector such as millers and wine merchants, but also included all the industries related to the military such as leather workers, saddle-makers, armourers and wood-workers. A focus on wine production and the arms industry was naturally not always a good mix in a city despite their fundamental value to overall infrastructure.',
'The Middle Guilds were made up of a mixed lot, for instance they included the livestock merchants, probably raised from importance over the lesser guilds due to their provision for wool which was so essential to the Major Guilds. They also included ironworkers and stonemasons which oddly contrasted to the Lesser Guilds'' woodworkers and armourers.',
'The Major Guilds covered several trades but what they had in common was that they were elite of the commune and allowed a control from the top down, they included the wealthiest merchants such as silk-weavers but also doctors, bankers and lawyers. They held power over the rest of the guilds usually due to their wealth and access to judicial and administrative processes. They were also very well-represented in the offices of the republic and the senatorial priori, meaning that they were the dominant force behind government. This oligarchic elite, although undisputedly of value to any republic and the economy were widely reviled by the populace.',
'Maiores referred to the ''important persons'' which more specifically differentiated from inferiores ''lesser men'' by meaning that a specific recognisable elite existed in the city. These ''great men'' were entitled knights, judges or doctors- and it was only these that were allowed to wear the symbol of their state- ''a doublet of silk and magisterially slashed shoes''. This uniform is apparent from several medieval portraits and frescoes from the period. Politicians such as the Nine of Siena were typical magnates of this class.',
'A maona or Societas comperarum was a medieval Italian association of investors formed to manage the purchased shares (loca or partes) of the revenue due to the relevant city-state through tax farming; the shares were individually sold to wealthy merchants, but the collection could be difficult and so these merchants would band together. These organizations were usually temporary, and could sometimes be extremely aggressive in extracting the monies due them; their actions went up to, and included, outright conquest. Maona were especially common in Genoa.',
'DO NOT TRANSLATE',
'The Tribunale della Mercanzia (Tribunal of Merchandise) was where lawyers judged disputes and rival claims between merchants. These investigations and proceedings could be extremely complex, involving economic as well as judicial ''warfare'' between rival houses and often involved conspiracies and politics. Considering the massive importance that the merchant class had for the power and wealth of the Italian republics, this tribunal- although hardly immune to corruption- was a vast step forward in controlling the civil conflicts.',
'A General Code, "Il Statuto", for the guilds was promulgated in 1296 with the founding of the Corte della Mercanzia (Court of Commerce). The Statutes of all the guilds in Florence underwent a complete revision between 1301 and 1307, and the "New Code" was first adopted by the Calimala (Wool merchants'' guild) who set the standard for all to follow due to their key placement between the various arms of the guilds castes; the statutes were again revised in 1386.',

'The Venetian Concione was basically what other Italian states called an Arengo, a public assembly. As a unique instituion however, it was one of the supreme fundamental offices of the Republic.',
'Founded in 1143, the Greater Assembly was adevelopment from the Concione. It convened in the Doge''s Palace and it''s members were chosen directly by the Doge.',
'Also called the Consiglio dei Saggi, or Council of Sages (wise men). In 1172 the Consilium was transformed into a sovereign assembly with the name of Greater Council or Maggior Consiglio, initially composed from 35 and later 100 councillors, which they joined by right of vote, from 1178.',

'The Council of the Forty or Supreme Court of the Quarantia also known simply as the Quarantia was one of the most important constitutional organs of the Republic of Venice, with a main function as forming and regulating legislative policies of a Supreme Court or Tribunal.',
'The Serene Council represented Venice''s glory days. It formed a centralised office of authority around the Doge, who served as the formal sovereign, six Ducal councillors elected from the Great Council by the members of the Minor Council and finally the Three Heads of the Quarantia, supreme judges.',
'The Council of the Pregadi (or Priviledged) was a final move in the Republican reforms of the centralised state of Venice. It was an attempt to create an ever more elite Senate, which overruled all the others- a form of House of Lords amongst the Patricians. Formed in 1229 it was a deliberately advanced assembly of the Republic, focussed on Venice''s new role as a superpower and specifically tasked itself with foreign politics. The Doge was naturally the supreme head of the Senate, but it received its members on annual election from the Grand Council. The Senate allowed its members to wear the red robes of office in contrast to the black of the other Patricians in the lower councils.',

'Nomadising, nomadic life, nomad camp. Gathering a group to go on the move was more difficult than just going on the move as a family, as nomads- the basic foundation of tribal kinship was the most essential building block of society. However organising a non-urbanised group into a socially-conscious force, designated as the core of a small settlement took some deliberate time and money to encourage.',
'Encampment, site of a camp, foundation of a yurt. A recognised settlement-site was for nomads, an organisation that required money and planning. For nomads, a settlement was a point to return to regularly- not a point to stand and stay. To return to a point, it would be a recognised and well-developed trading point, a pre-ordained and well-known crossroads for traffic where festivals, taxation, military organisation and law would all be focussed. But the foundation of a gathering of yurts was a very simple operation for a nomadic people, it just required incentive.',
'Station, camp, inn, halt, stop. A recognised gathering point for the nomads would draw them from afar if there was an infrastructure to pull them in, if trade would be worthwhile and guaranteed. The problem for the majority of nomads in moving to and fro well-known sites was the danger to banditry and raids from rival clans or tribes. If a settlement could guarantee the security of the outlying area then the caravans would come.',
'Hamlet of yurts, place of assembly of people of the same rank. Nomads could consider a settlement or camp as a well-established centre of power if the heads of various clans and tribes had gathered at the same point and could live in peace and agreement. Only under an authoritative figure of a great khan could this be achieved. ',
'Consisted of 1,000 tent-families. To maintain such an economy the Mongol cattle-raisers had to move from place to place in separate ail or families. In the conditions of feudal division and internecine strife, the huree or ring-shaped disposition of families was widely used as a means of defence against surprise attack. The leader''s tent was in the centre. According to Rashid-ad-Din, every huree consisted of 1,000 tent-families.',

'A Port brings trade to a settlement. Indeed, moving goods by water is the only way to carry large cargoes long distances cheaply and thus turn a profit. The need to keep merchant ships in good order also means that the necessary skills to make military vessels can be found here.',
'A Shipwright has the slipway, wood seasoning stores and manpower needed to build ships for a strong fleet. The improved port buildings - and simple improvements like creating permanent wharves along a waterfront - allow more trade to occur.',
'A Dockyard allows the construction of larger ships, and the improved wharves make trade easier to manage. Goods from all over the world pass through the docks, bringing wealth and excitement into the lives of citizens.',
'A Naval Dockyard allows the construction of all kinds of ships, and gives control of the port to a properly appointed representative of the crown rather than the local merchants. Trade, however, continues to flourish as the docks are superbly maintained and dredged.',

'Path, road. Nomads especially in the geography of the Steppe had no limits to where they could travel. However the Steppe nomads, especially the Mongols were more than capable of developing infrastructure that used traditional routes and established an organised official imperial network along these routes.',
'Road, way, path. One of the basic developments in the road systems of the Steppe was the establishment of stations along traditional routes, usually giving support or even security to the passers-by, naturally it was of greatest benefit to trade caravans and military services.',
'Wide road, highway',
'Road or roadside post, stopping place by road used as landmark, often with a minor religious significance. Often a small semi-permanent outpost of yurts would develop here creating a kind of hostel, series of shops and the basic ingredients of a settlement.',
'Roadblock, military checkposts',
'Throughout the empire, trade routes and an extensive postal system were created.',

'Horse-relay post service (ortoo), to ensure prompt communication within the empire''s entire administration as well as transportation of messengers and dignitaries',

'Ovoo (hill), heap or cairn, is the equivalent of a shaman''s shrine (altar). This is a heap of bones or stone formed by man. They would be inhabited by spirits of the locality, local deities (nibdagh and shiddagh) of the Mongolian people. When passing by an ovoo, travellers are required to walk around it three times (clockwise) and place a rock on it. By doing this, they symbolically add to the spirit’s power, as by adding the rock he receives energy for his windhorse (personal psychic power) and good luck for his journey. Ovoo are also the place of several ceremonies during the year which nearby families or clans would celebrate in honor of the local spirit as well as Father Heaven and Mother Earth and other shaman spirits. Mountain spirits and other powerful Gazriin Ezen are worshipped at these special shrines.',
'The barisaa (prayer tree - shrine) is an important site of worship. This ritual brings peace and reduces violence in whatever place it is performed in. It needs to be done in as many places as possible, especially in places that were sites of deaths because of war or violence. It also calls the nature spirits to bring inspiration, calm people''s hearts, and create thoughts of peace and love. This is the act of performing ariulga, this is cleansing your soul from the evil nature spirits. The ritual for the calming (reducing of negative energy) of the spirits will have a permanent effect from which all people in the community where it is done, not only the participants, will benefit. The tree has now become a barisaa, a shaman shrine for the nature spirits. A tree symbolizes the world center, where Heaven and earth touch, where all times and places converge. They may be honored by tying on pieces of cloth. The lone birch, the "shaman tree", is called ongonmodon, for these trees are believed to be the home of the shamans'' helper spirits, Ongon. Trees are also symbolic of the World Tree, which is usually visualized as a birch or willow.',
'Another type of ritual tree is the serge, which is made from a young birch. Some of them were once souls of human beings, ancestors from a time so long ago. A mountain or tree of great majesty will be said to have suld, which is the same word that is used to refer to the soul which remains in nature after death. Unusual rocks or trees are believed to have a strong spirit and are respected or given offerings of tobacco or liquor. Mountain spirits are considered to be very powerful, and are prayed to in order to provide good hunting and abundance of natural food plants. These ceremonies are usually held roughly around the times of the equinoxes and solstices and are usually performed by the elders of the local clan or tribe.',

'Constructing Ballista Towers atop settlement walls allows a defending force to shower any attackers with iron bolts, a sensible improvement for almost any siege scenario. Any besieging force has to stay beyond range until the moment of their attack, and must then run a terrible gauntlet of missile fire.',
'Guns are a sensible addition to any defence, and Cannon Towers are suitably intimidating to any attacker brave - or foolhardy - enough to come within range. Their massive size is necessary to absorb the tremendous shock of repeated firing and to stand against any enemy guns.',

'Nomadising, nomadic life, nomad camp. Gathering a group to go on the move was more difficult than just going on the move as a family, as nomads- the basic foundation of tribal kinship was the most essential building block of society. However organising a non-urbanised group into a socially-conscious force, designated as the core of a small settlement took some deliberate time and money to encourage.',
'Encampment, site of a camp, foundation of a yurt. A recognised settlement-site was for nomads, an organisation that required money and planning. For nomads, a settlement was a point to return to regularly- not a point to stand and stay. To return to a point, it would be a recognised and well-developed trading point, a pre-ordained and well-known crossroads for traffic where festivals, taxation, military organisation and law would all be focussed. But the foundation of a gathering of yurts was a very simple operation for a nomadic people, it just required incentive.',
'Station, camp, inn, halt, stop. A recognised gathering point for the nomads would draw them from afar if there was an infrastructure to pull them in, if trade would be worthwhile and guaranteed. The problem for the majority of nomads in moving to and fro well-known sites was the danger to banditry and raids from rival clans or tribes. If a settlement could guarantee the security of the outlying area then the caravans would come.',

'The Catholics take possession of the land, after conquest from Taifa states and Muslims. They would naturally convert the old inhabitants, but also seek to bring in fresh blood, and their own culture. This phase would normally involve Scalio (cultivation) of the land, irrigation and designation of ownership. There was also the process of Cartae Populationis (censors and charters) which gave land grants to new colonists but also acted as a binding contract with the feudal lords to better facilitate the extraction of taxes.',
'Fuero is related to the Latin word ''forum''. There were a range of fuero, such as fuero militar, a military code of justice or fuero eclesiástico, relating to the Church. These were basically a more well-defined issue of law and charters, calling in the debts of the initial boom of grants. On the other hand, fueros could also be written to entitle the region to keep its old or uniquely regional laws perhaps representing the pecularities of population or customs.',
'A Concejo is the most direct continuation of the fuero, it is the creation of new municipalities, once given a royal concession by the fueros. The concejos can be created in cities with large Moorish population and will generally be a means to financially maximise the potential of those settlements that have already reached a good population size. Law and Order can be a problem in these settlements however, but normally income is very good.',
'This encourages a military order to take over government of the region. This has several benefits despite giving up much of the land to support the knights and the military, which means a lose of revenue. The knights increase religious conversion and they also enforce laws and taxes, although the money usually pays for their recruitment of new units. A military order offers some of the best military units available and although they can be quite demanding and require the sacrifice of many other potential benefits of crown ownership, they make up for this in self-sufficiency.',
'By granting land to specific nobles, you increase their power which can be dangerous or beneficial depending on what you have planned for the character. A noble will generally require autonomy which means that you will not have control over recruitment or construction but you can expect that the settlement will be run effiiciently without requiring your intervention, ....that is as long as the noble in question can be kept in check.',

'The Catholics take possession of the land, after conquest from Taifa states and Muslims. They would naturally convert the old inhabitants, but also seek to bring in fresh blood, and their own culture.',
'Fuero is related to the Latin word ''forum''. There were a range of fuero, such as fuero militar, a military code of justice or fuero eclesiástico, relating to the Church. These were basically a more well-defined issue of law and charters, calling in the debts of the initial boom of grants.',
'A Concejo is the most direct continuation of the fuero, it is the creation of new municipalities, once given a royal concession by the fueros. The concejos can be created in cities with large Moorish population and will generally be a means to financially maximise the potential of those settlements that have already reached a good population size. Law and Order can be a problem in these settlements however, but normally income is very good.',
'This encourages a military order to take over government of the region. This has several benefits despite giving up much of the land to support the knights and the military, which means a lose of revenue.',
'By granting land to specific nobles, you increase their power which can be dangerous or beneficial depending on what you have planned for the character.',

'The need to protect the Anatolian heartland of Byzantium from the Arab raids led to the creation, in the later 8th and early 9th centuries, of a series of small frontier districts, the kleisourai or kleisourarchiai ("defiles, enclosures"). The term was previously used to signify strategically important, fortified mountain passages, and was now expanded to entire districts which formed separate commands under a kleisourarchēs, tasked with guerrilla warfare and locally countering small to mid-scale incursions and raids. Gradually, most of these were elevated to full themes. With the beginning of the Byzantine offensives in the East and the Balkans in the 10th century, especially under the warrior-emperors Nikephoros II (r. 963–969), John I Tzimiskes (r.969–976) and Basil II (r. 976–1025), newly gained territories were also incorporated into themes, although these were generally smaller than the original themes established in the 7th and 8th centuries.Most consisted merely of a fortress and its surrounding territory, with a lesser stratēgos as a commander and about 1,000 men as their garrison. In the East, where many were populated or resettled with Armenians, they became known as the "small" (μικρὰ θέματα) or "Armenian" themes (ἀρμενικὰ θέματα), in contrast to the traditional "great" or "Roman" themes (ῥωμαϊκά θέματα)',
'Related to the modern English word ''procedure'' Prosodoi was the basic formation of taxation. When used in a general sense it refers to property taxes and confisactions, but over time the term became more spefic as a widespread poll-tax. Tracing its original concept back to Aristotle, it was the basic procedural command of government in a region. Prosodoi revenues were usually obtained from Ktémata.',
'Small estates with heavy use of slaves, who acted with more freedom as servants and informal family members. This important strata of society were free landowning estate farmers who formed a strong middle class between the workers and the produce from their lands. These ''free lands'' where landowners would mix with whom were tehnically slaves meant that a general form of society abounded in these provinces, where the class systems rules were more fluid and men were judged on their role in the community rather than who owned who. Although this culture was looked down on by the urbanites and the more civilised upper classes, in its context these provincials were in themselves much more efficient at maintaining the peace, and producing large harvests and culls of livestock. The longstanding ''Imperial Peace'' came not from the sword of the army, but from the culture of the subject communities, the cooonies such as in Thrace that lacked this free social system were the ones more likely to be troubled bu civil strife and rebellion.',
'Ktémata was the general term for property and estates, more specifically a lord''s Ktémata would include his paroikoi villeins, his own teams of oxen used for sowing seed and could be bred for meat or hides. It would also include all the property of his vassals particularly the tenant paroikoi and their oxen as well as their harvests, it included the pasture lands under his dominion, the orchards and any range of fruit-bearing tree, it was also documented who many non-fruit bearing trees the lord had which could be used as timber for construction or shipbuilding. Ktémata was well-documented throughout a Themata as it allowed the Empire to keep complete track of its own accumalative wealth, and the wealth of its subjects that could be better taxed, controlled and their assets utilised for the greater good of the Empire.',
'Rhogai refered to state salaries, given to soldier, seaman and of course generals. Within a Thema, rhogai were all the rents, taxes and dues from land tenure and feudal service that were OWING to the lord. As medieval Byzantine governorships became much more territorial and rather feudal, the lords in question would be very focussed on the Thematic rhogai and the actual wealth as well as the debts within his region, they were paid systematically every three or four years but counted out annually. In 809 the Bulgarians captured and seized the Rhogai treasury of one four year period for the Styrmon region, it amounted to well over 10,000 florins. Again in 811 the Arabs captured the Armeniakon with a similar rhogai amount. This tells us that the majority or Thema generated a rhogai of roughly 1500 florins per 6-month period. The amounts of money required to be calculated en masse brought about a system of chancelleries and local tax stations that defined an estate by its rhogai, in a form of equity- estate ownership and noble status were often based on the allotment and quality of their Rhogai. More importantly it was by the division and cataloguing of possessions and asset wealth that taxation and state income as well as the general governorship could be applied much more precisely. The system of offices, administration and bureaucracy in the Byzantine Empire was extremely efficient and in many ways was the very lifeblood of the Empror''s Rule.',

'Mills were a very important asset in the medieval world. Originally developed by the Muslims, watermills were an excellent way of helping irrigation but of also using waterpower to drive mills wheels used in griding grain- an otherwise very long and gruelling job. Mills removed the work of grinding from the labour of the people and in turn produced a steady and very fast flow of grain for bread. Water driven mills were hydrokinéta and animal-driven (drawn by mules) were called zóokinéta. The improvement of rural life and the ability to free workers from this task and allow them to work on other tasks in the fields refined the entire agrciultural process. Increased production could allow the excess to be traded, or stpred for hard times such as winter or famine.',
'Grain silos were a rather technical invention, stockpiling any vegetable substance in the hot climate of Greece or Anatolia would cause the material to rot, spontaneously combust, to yeast or to become infested with insects and rodents. With the improvements of agricultural methods that allowed a large annual harvest production and crop yield not all excess was traded off out of the region- much of it had to be stored to cover the rest of the year when food was harder to come by. Silos were run by the state, the grain tax culled all the excess from the region- the farmers were happy to pay in tax what would otherwise be wasted- and besides within a few months the grain would be sold back to them for their own use. Sorting grain was not within the means of most towns and certainly not within the abilities of small estates. Grain silos employed the Thematic militias in gathering, documenting and then guarding the produce until it was needed during the winter. Small rural silos were often plundered by rival famers or bandits, whereas the large urban silos allowed Imperial protection and an entire administrative system to keep check and to fairly distribute the profits across the community.',

'Socage was one of the feudal duties and hence land tenure forms in the feudal system, it had its roots in Anglo-Saxon government. A farmer, for example, held the land in exchange for a clearly-defined, fixed payment to be made at specified intervals to his feudal lord, who in turn had his own feudal obligations, to the farmer and to the Crown. In theory this might involve supplying the lord with produce but most usually it meant a straightforward payment of cash, i.e., rent. In this respect it contrasted with other forms of tenure including serjeanty (the farmer paid no rent but had to perform some personal/official service on behalf of his lord, including in times of war) and frankalmoin (some form of religious service). For those higher up the feudal pyramid, there was also knight-service (military service) as a condition of land tenure.',
'Frankalmoin or frankalmoigne (from Norman French fraunch aumoyne “free alms”) was one of the feudal land tenures in feudal England. By it an ecclesiastical body held land in return for saying prayers and masses for the soul of the granter. Not only was secular service frequently not due but in the 12th and 13th centuries jurisdiction over land so held belonged to the ecclesiastical courts. Thus, in English law, frankalmoign(e) was tenure in free alms. Gifts to religious institutions in free alms were defined first as gifts to God, then to the patron saint of the religious house, and finally to those religious serving God in the specific house. Religious houses in receipt of free alms could not recognise a secular lord. The gift of land or other property made over to God and to a patron Saint was inalienable, and the relationship between the grantor and the religious house was subsidiary. In the 12th century the institution came to be misused. Land could be donated to a church organization and then leased back to the donor, allowing the donor to avoid the feudal services due to his lord. Legal cases became so complicated that the Assize of Utrum was established in the middle of the 12th century to adjudicate claims.',
'The form of taxation known as scutage, in the law of England under the feudal system, allowed a knight to "buy out" of the military service due to the Crown as a holder of a knight''s fee held under the feudal land tenure of knight-service. Its name derived from shield (in Latin: scutum). The term sometimes loosely applies to other pecuniary levies on the basis of the knight''s fee. This was useful to the king when income was more important than the need for large numbers of knights in service. The institution existed under Henry I (reigned 1100–1135) and Stephen (reigned 1135–1154), when it occurs as scutagium, scuagium or escuagium. The creation of fractions of knights'' fee probably hastened its introduction: the holders of such fractions could only discharge their obligation via scutage. The increasing use of mercenaries in the 12th century would also make a money payment of greater use to the crown. Separate levies of scutage received the names of the campaigns for which they were raised, as "the scutage of Toulouse" (or "great scutage"), "the scutage of Ireland", and so forth. The levy demanded from each fee one marc (13s. 4d., two thirds of a pound), one pound or two marcs, but anything above a pound seemed abnormal till John (reigned 1199–1216) imposed levies of two marcs in most years without even the excuse of a war. The irritation caused by these exactions reached a climax in 1214, when John demanded three marcs, and this became a prominent cause among the many causes that led the barons to insist on the Great Charter (1215). Its provisions prohibited the crown from levying any scutage save by "the common counsel of our realm".',
'Paramount (derived from the Anglo-French word paramont, which means up above, or par a mont, meaning up or on top of the mountain), is the highest authority, or that being of the greatest importance. The word was first used as a term of feudal law, of the lord, the lord paramount, who held his fief from no superior lord, and was thus opposed to mesne lord, one who held from a superior. To those who held their fiefs from one who was not a lord paramount was given the correlative term paravail, (from par d val, meaning in the valley). The word was confused by English lawyers with "avail," help, assistance, profit, and applied to the actual working tenant of the land, the lowest tenant or occupier. A well-documented example of paramountcy is the Lordship of Bowland. In 1311, it was subsumed as part of the Honor of Clitheroe into the Earldom of Lancaster. After 1351, it was administered as part of the Duchy of Lancaster, with the Duke (from 1399, the Sovereign) acknowledged lord paramount over the Forest of Bowland and the ten manors of the Liberty of Bowland. As lord paramount, he was styled Lord King of Bowland. Generally rare in England, this is the highest form of autonomy.',
'A tenant-in-chief, sometimes vassal-in-chief, denotes the nobles who held their lands as tenants directly from the monarch, as opposed to holding them from another nobleman or senior member of the clergy. Such people were the backbone of the monarchs'' authority throughout the state and included princes and dukes (many of whom would have been immediate relatives of the monarch), and earls. The Latin term was tenant in capiti, or in capite referring to them being the head of their province in service to the monarch. This form of feudalism was the traditional means of binding the nobles to the crown, not only by allowing a fully-controlled and sanctioned intermediary but also enforcing military obligation of the lord in question.',
'The origin of the word ''honour'', literally the territorial domains within a noble''s control and ownership which turn deisngated his social status and his place at court. His personal properties were inhabited by peasants who enjoyed his protection and the greater governorship he provided.',
'In English law, subinfeudation is the practice by which tenants, holding land under the king or other superior lord, carved out new and distinct tenures in their turn by sub-letting or alienating a part of their lands. This gave power to the lords who allowed themselves to sit at the top of a chain of sub-lettings and control all the holdings of the freemen within his domains. It did however encourage a growing independency from serfdom and the allowance of a growing peasantry with small freeholdings. It also encouraged the development of hamlets and small localised communities.',
'Quia Emptores (medieval Latin for "because the buyers", the incipit of the writ or document) was a statute passed in 1290 by Edward I of England that prevented tenants from alienating their lands to others by subinfeudation, instead requiring all tenants wishing to alienate their land to do so by substitution. Quia Emptores, along with its companion statute of Quo Warranto, was intended to remedy land ownership disputes and consequent financial difficulties that had resulted from the decline of the traditional feudal system during the High Middle Ages. It was popular with the lower classes but subjugated the nobles.',
'Quo warranto had its origins in an attempt by King Edward I of England to investigate and recover royal lands, rights, and franchises in England, in particular those lost during the reign of his father, King Henry III of England. From 1278 to 1294, Edward dispatched justices throughout the Kingdom of England to inquire “by what warrant” English lords held their lands and exercised their jurisdictions (often the right to hold a court and collect its profits). Initially, the justices demanded written proof in the form of charters, but resistance and the unrecorded nature of many grants forced Edward to accept those rights peacefully exercised since 1189. Later, quo warranto functioned as a court order (or "writ") to show proof of authority; for example, demanding that someone acting as the sheriff prove that the king had actually appointed him to that office (literally, "By whose warrant are you the sheriff?").',

'Socage was one of the feudal duties and hence land tenure forms in the feudal system, it had its roots in Anglo-Saxon government. A farmer, for example, held the land in exchange for a clearly-defined, fixed payment to be made at specified intervals to his feudal lord, who in turn had his own feudal obligations, to the farmer and to the Crown.',
'Frankalmoin or frankalmoigne (from Norman French fraunch aumoyne “free alms”) was one of the feudal land tenures in feudal England.',
'The form of taxation known as scutage, in the law of England under the feudal system, allowed a knight to "buy out" of the military service due to the Crown as a holder of a knight''s fee held under the feudal land tenure of knight-service. Its name derived from shield (in Latin: scutum).',
'Paramount (derived from the Anglo-French word paramont, which means up above, or par a mont, meaning up or on top of the mountain), is the highest authority, or that being of the greatest importance. The word was first used as a term of feudal law, of the lord, the lord paramount, who held his fief from no superior lord, and was thus opposed to mesne lord, one who held from a superior.',
'A tenant-in-chief, sometimes vassal-in-chief, denotes the nobles who held their lands as tenants directly from the monarch, as opposed to holding them from another nobleman or senior member of the clergy. Such people were the backbone of the monarchs'' authority throughout the state and included princes and dukes (many of whom would have been immediate relatives of the monarch), and earls.',
'The origin of the word ''honour'', literally the territorial domains within a noble''s control and ownership which turn deisngated his social status and his place at court. His personal properties were inhabited by peasants who enjoyed his protection and the greater governorship he provided.',
'In English law, subinfeudation is the practice by which tenants, holding land under the king or other superior lord, carved out new and distinct tenures in their turn by sub-letting or alienating a part of their lands.',
'Quia Emptores (medieval Latin for "because the buyers", the incipit of the writ or document) was a statute passed in 1290 by Edward I of England that prevented tenants from alienating their lands to others by subinfeudation, instead requiring all tenants wishing to alienate their land to do so by substitution.',
'Quo warranto had its origins in an attempt by King Edward I of England to investigate and recover royal lands, rights, and franchises in England, in particular those lost during the reign of his father, King Henry III of England. From 1278 to 1294, Edward dispatched justices throughout the Kingdom of England to inquire “by what warrant” English lords held their lands and exercised their jurisdictions (often the right to hold a court and collect its profits).',

'Literally the ''peace of the land'' which naturally came from an organised military which acted as militia and garrison.',
'In Germany, thirteenth century law-codes assert Folgepflicht (a duty to follow) which bore upon the peoples of Saxony and Austria, but it is difficult to trace this back. Certain passages by Widukind, the Saxon chronicler, have been much discussed, but he never describes a peasant army. There were certainly peasants in the Saxon armies that rebelled against Henry IV, but according to the Carmen they were brought by the knights and nobles. Henry IV saw the treachery of some knights lead to the slaughter of his infantry at Bleichfeldt in 1086, but on what basis these men were raised is not known. In fact, the evidence suggests that if there had ever been an ancient and universal obligation to bear arms, it was largely forgotten by the start of this period and was something that the rulers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries tried to invent for their own purposes.',
'House fiefs given to ministeriales who were the national service knights. These fiefs did not require nor were repayment for service since this was a feudal duty, it was a logical way of garrisoning these vital troops to a specific imperial territory however.',

'The first wave of settlers allows you to establish law and increase the population, but the long journey from their homelands leaves many malnourished and riddle with disease, food can also be very scarce as newcomers arrive and find no farms, no infrastructure and no community. So don''t expect many of your new settlers to live long unless you improve other conditions.',
'Borderlands were officially recognised frontiers. Religious, ethnic or cultural differences to the Holy Roman Empire would motivate the declaration of martial law. It was sometimes strategically wise to establish a good military presence in the region at the expense of all other concerns. Colonisation can after all take decades and be a very risky business.',
'A house of the Germans, referred rather understatedly to the establishment of German Crusader knights. These would come from any number of orders, but the Teutonic Order held dominance by Papal command in any case. These bases did little to promote Christianity in themselves since they served a purely military function and were not usually an inspirational or comforting sight. The knights were ruthless warriors and their method was to subjugate not to colonise.',
'The establishment of strongholds for the Teutonic Knights enabled them to move more freely throughout their domains and enabled regular patrols, undermining the risk of ambush. These forts also made maintaining equipment and horses far easier.',
'This region has officially come under the total jurisdiction of the Teutonic Order.',
'Germans introduced the Hufenverfassung system to divide and classify the land. Farmland was divided into Hufen, much like English hides, with one Hufe (25 to 40 hectares depending on the region) plentifully supplying one farm. This led to new types of villages, often having farm buildings form on both sides of a single long main road with their Hufen behind, although Wendish village types were adopted and adjusted too. Germans also introduced new systems of taxation. While the Wendish tithe was a fixed tax depending on village size, the German tithe depended on the actual crop, leading to higher taxes being collected from settlers than from the Wends, even though settlers were at least in part exempted from taxes in the first years after the settlement was established. This was a major reason for local rulers'' keenness to invite settlers, since they could be taxed at a higher rate than the natives and since it was the same system as at home, they would be more willing to cooperate than the natives were.',
'Usually, a Slavic market place would be an open range with few or no permanently inhabited buildings and, after Christianization, a church. These market fields (ring, rynek) were in close proximity, but not within villages or fortified strongholds. The locals held trade monopolies; the trade itself was carried out by foreign merchants (mostly Germans and Jews, but also Italians and others), who would arrive at the market with their wagons and pay the locals owning the market a fee. This system was borrowed from 10th century East Francia and persisted in the Slavic regions, while in the West it had already transformed into a system of towns (permanently settled market places with residential merchant guilds and an economy of their own). Rynek were therefore rather vulnerable trade outposts which left them susceptible to brigandage.',
'When towns were introduced in the East during the Ostsiedlung, they were established preferably on the site of former market rings. The new towns were first termed "schroda" or "sroda". Local rulers as well as clergy granted land and privileges to increase the density of towns in their realms, as these were thought to accelerate economic growth and prosperity and to function as strongholds. During the establishment of a town, the income of the ruler was ensured by selling monopolies to the merchants. Once the town was established and began to flourish, the ruler derived income from taxes. Suburbanisation usually meant that sexual activities would soar, but health would drop due to the lack of hygiene facilities in the streets and the close-living raised the risk of infectious diseases. Nonetheless, townships drew tradesmen and commerce from affair, also densely populated settlements allowed taxation and government to operate more efficiently.',
'The financial success of the region allows the fortification of outposts, villages, markets, roads and borders with strongholds, or Castra in Latin. Not only do these improve law, but they encourage trade since there is a need for maintaining troops’ equipment.',

'This meant Imperial Immediacy whereby the Emperor or Electoral Council intervened in the constitution of a state, offering privileged and political status to replace formerly clear and traditional feudal controls. It was applied to an imperial city, religious entity or feudal principality within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing them varying modifications of vassalage and freedoms. It was a means to update the relationship between members of the Empire and the rulers that held sway. This was very useful during the times of political and religious upheaval, development of human and civil rights, the rise of medieval populations, as well as the occasional failures in feudal management.',
'Imperial Freedom was granted by the Emperor or Electoral Council to formally remove the former constitutional control of the settlement by its previous rulers. In effect it did not effect the actual status of the former lord, regardless of whether he kept his secular title. It only effected his control over his former estate, this would natural undermine the authority and authority of most lords but in many cases a representative overlord was still required in these settlements even if his role was mainly ceremonial. A city that was granted Freedom of the Empire, could take on many forms ironically- with varying degrees or interpretations of what that freedom should entail.',
'Imperial Cities were those formally ruled by secular princes. The Emperor or Electorial Council was able to apply a more direct control, far greater and more actual than Imperial Immediacy. As a vassal of the Emperor, the city itself paid taxes and had to supply troops for his military campaigns. It was an informal accession to becoming an Imperial Estate, and personal dominion of the Emperor. It was unpopular but reminded his vassals who was in charge. It also helped fill the coffers, since direct taxation was possible even if it meant taking food from the mouths of peasants.',
'Free Cities were those formally ruled by a prince-bishop. They were not required to pay Imperial taxes or raise troops except during a Crusade, and had other additional rights and privileges (which varied greatly among them). The Free Cities that gained independence from their prince-bishops during the High Middle Ages were Basel (1000), Worms (1074), Mainz (1244, revoked 1462), Regensburg (1245), Strasbourg (1272), Cologne (1288), and Speyer (1294). The accession of a Freie Stadt passed control of the city from the Prince-Bishopric to the merchants, no doubt a sign of the Empire having learnt from the successes of the merchant states in Italy.',
'Although technically there were only two options available to cities within the Empire, autonomy or vassalage, over time the difference became more and more blurred so that a few "Free and Imperial Cities" were collectively known in the Diet as "Free Imperial Cities". What mattered more was the difference in wealth: rich cities, such as Lübeck or Augsburg, were genuinely self-ruling enclaves within the Empire and the temptation was to grant the power of Freie Stadt to as many states as possible to stimulate financial gains. However, the political and strategic interests involved forced a compromise to be made, and these were the Freie Reichsstadt- a city both Imperiall governed and Free. Although a contradiction in terms it constitutionally freed the city from raising troops but tax could be more definitely extracted whilst encouraging a sense of independence and self-government.',

'No doubt seeing the developments of ‘revised constitutions’ in Germany as being a parallel change to those of the Italian communes, the German free states would often seek to ally themselves into small contingencies, similar to the Lombard League and others. Städtebünde (city leagues), such as the Hanseatic League were formed to strengthen and protect the freedoms these states had acquired. In many cases they would share military as well as commercial resources, but could lean towards notions of independent states. Some members of these alliances were never Free Cities and joined with the permission of their territorial rulers, however for the most part City Leagues were a great mercantile venture but were a politically ambiguous entity.',

'No doubt seeing the developments of ‘revised constitutions’ in Germany as being a parallel change to those of the Italian communes, the German free states would often seek to ally themselves into small contingencies, similar to the Lombard League and others. Städtebünde (city leagues), such as the Hanseatic League were formed to strengthen and protect the freedoms these states had acquired. In many cases they would share military as well as commercial resources, but could lean towards notions of independent states. Some members of these alliances were never Free Cities and joined with the permission of their territorial rulers, however for the most part City Leagues were a great mercantile venture but were a politically ambiguous entity.',

'Fallow lands, originally conceived by Magyar tribes as outlands beyond the settlements used for grazing their horses and acting as a form of open buffer zone against foreign states. The Gyepű was a strip of land that was specially fortified or made impassable, while Gyepűelve was the mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited land beyond it. These technically belonged to the King, and as the need for grazing lands by settled urbanised Magyars declined these lands could be given to foreign peoples who would populate the vast expanses, they would act as federal guards similar to the tradition of Roman resettlement.',
'Of all the medieval immigrants to Hungary the ‘Saxons’ were by far the most numerous. Many not only settled on the frontier but worked for the king directly, bringing the expertise of the Holy Roman Empire in organisation and government. In reality these ‘Saxons’ were often from areas such Franconia and particularly merchants from Flanders. There were also massive populations of Englishmen after the defeat at Hastings and the dispossession of Anglo-Saxon gentry by Norman lords. Numerous “Ecclesia Theutonicorum Ultrasilvanorum" are recorded in 1191, and mercantile "priores Flandrenses" during 1192-1196. Also several German terms came into official use such as border (Verhausäume) guarded settlements (Wehrsiedlungen), Crown Land (Königsboden) and desolate land (Ödlandstreifen).',
'These were basically Church-Fortresses. The ‘Saxons’, would make their defences around their few single most important stone constructions- such as the church. Also, priests would act as local governors, educating the immigrants on their rights, representing them to the Hungarian masters and overseeing village development. Priests acted as lawyers, architects and translators in addition to their common tasks as doctors. With the establishment of ‘Saxon’ communities came a massive increase in skilled miners from the central west of Germany. Miners’ rights were given generously to these new communities and proved so successful that in the early 12th century, Hungarian royal income was double that of England in silver alone.',
'Despite the Magyars and Székelys appearing to have common roots, it is clear that they still considered themselves a separate people. This was a sensitive situation for the fledgling Hungarian state, since it needed its allies and could not risk alienating them for fear of jeopardising the state. However, sharing land and kingdom was less than ideal. Székelys claimed decent from Attila the Hun and were originally the enemies of the invading Arpads during Magyar settlement. In time, the Székelys were clearly marginalised but where nonetheless accepted and to some degree incorporated within the Hungarian nation. The Unio Trium Nationum "Union of the Three Nations" reflects this alliance. Indeed Székelys were powerful friends, making excellent warriors, experts still in the semi-nomadic horse archery that the Magyars were beginning to outgrow. Székelys, similar to Transylvanian Saxons, were organised in Seats (Hungarian: szék, Latin: Sedes) which were autonomous territorial units. The main advantages of encouraging Székely settlement were mainly military, and they proved their worth in defending Hungary from Tartar invaders in the 1200s and again against the Ottomans in the late 1400s. They were however exempt from all forms of taxation in return.',
'Royal Farming Domains were in fact the original value of the Gyepű, and enabled the King by feudal law to give the land away to settlers. However, it was equally possible to keep frontier lands within strictly Hungarian control although the benefits were more long-term.',
'This was a mainly mounted force which acted as a combined levy, militia and national guard retinue. It allowed a more efficient military organisation in the frontier regions, but it did keep men from their work and homes.',
'-',
'The Hungarian “right of hospitality" was put it in writing by Andrew II, although it had been proclaimed by earlier monarchs. It issued a document of privileges, a "Guarantee of Freedom" in 1224 and contained the most refined and extensive privileges any settlers from the West had received in Eastern Europe. It encouraged local businesses and granted free land rights, it was however aimed more specifically at the German populace since they were the ones with all the money. This bill of rights was finally able to establish taxation roughly around 100 florins a year per territory on the now largely integrated communities, and formally require feudal service in the military.',

'These were basically Church-Fortresses. The ‘Saxons’, would make their defences around their few single most important stone constructions- such as the church. Also, priests would act as local governors, educating the immigrants on their rights, representing them to the Hungarian masters and overseeing village development.',
'Despite the Magyars and Székelys appearing to have common roots, it is clear that they still considered themselves a separate people. This was a sensitive situation for the fledgling Hungarian state, since it needed its allies and could not risk alienating them for fear of jeopardising the state.',
'Royal Farming Domains were in fact the original value of the Gyepű, and enabled the King by feudal law to give the land away to settlers. However, it was equally possible to keep frontier lands within strictly Hungarian control although the benefits were more long-term.',
'This was a mainly mounted force which acted as a combined levy, militia and national guard retinue. It allowed a more efficient military organisation in the frontier regions, but it did keep men from their work and homes.',

'The Hungarian “right of hospitality" was put it in writing by Andrew II, although it had been proclaimed by earlier monarchs. It issued a document of privileges, a "Guarantee of Freedom" in 1224 and contained the most refined and extensive privileges any settlers from the West had received in Eastern Europe.',

'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',

'This land has been claimed directly by the Velikiy Knyaz, all military and civilian developments are fully within his control.',
'Veche –tribal council, a basic assembly for major towns from which a fledgling state could develop controlling a wider area.',
'Pomestie - "service landholding," was a parcel of land (hopefully inhabited by rent-paying peasants, later serfs in exchange for which the holder (not owner) had to render lifelong service to the state, typically military service, but occasionally service in the government bureaucracy. Ideally, when the service ended, the landholder had to surrender the pomestie to another serviceman. The pomestie was granted for use only to support the serviceman and his family (including slaves) by peasant rent payments to him in lieu of cash. This was similar to western feudalism such as sergeantry. This system granted law, and a large source of tax and agriculture since the state controlled all aspects of government.',
'Council of Lords, the executive organ of the Novgorodian and Pskovian veches. Usually made up by former and serving Posadniks, Tysyatskys and Boyars it was led by a high serving member of the clergy such as an Archbishop, and in this way was meant to represent a more republican government.',
'Suburbs, literally "ends", historically these were the five boroughs into which medieval Novgorod the Great was divided. They were based on the three original settlements that combined to form the city. It is believed that the decisions of the all-city veche had to be ratified by the Veches of each End. It is also thought that each End governed one of the Fifths, the five organized territories into which the Novgorodian Land had been divided.',
'This land has been granted to a lord in feudal service of a greater Knyaz, this vassalage allows good military structure, and economic infrastructure but direct control is limited.',
'Rada –council or assembly. In basic terms it meant the magnates of a territory were gathered and could be more readily authorityd by a single authority such as a rising prince.',
'Votchina -patrimonial lands, from the word ’father’, was an East Slavic land estate that could be inherited. The term "votchina" was also used to describe the lands of a knyaz. The term originated in the law of Kievan Rus. An owner of votchina not only had property rights to it, but also some administrative and legal power over people living on its territory. These people, however, were not serfs, as they had a right to freely move to different votchinas. This was similar to the western freeholdings or villeinry. It was popular among the people but did not provide a great deal of income from agriculture since there was no strict and formal taxation.',
'Feudal rule, this was part of a larger social and political move of the entire nation. In this system, a noble was appointed to a service position on the basis of their family’s rank. The state also developed a census taking, and an organized military during this period of development, historically it has been seen as a very harsh form of government, it was very popular after the reclamation of lands from the Mongols. It provided a great amount of law and tax control but was very unpopular among the masses.',

'Sesti were city quarters, they were policed by a lottery of freemen all of whom had shift duties in militia patrols, maintaining their own part of the city walls, as well as acting as a fire department. Men of each sesti even made up sports teams and wore specific colours, similar to rival football teams, backing these gangs the city quarters would often riot against each other, proud of their own streets. The different districts, such as the harbour district, or banking district would all have their own mafia houses or ‘famiglia’ run by Signori the masters of these clans. Signoria were the godfathers and represented the merchants, bankers, artisan guilds and nobles that all competed in cutthroat conspiracies to dominate the city and undermine their rivals. Although a real boost to urban pride and culture it was a dangerous underworld, it was also the foundation for future republican government and the start of the oligarchies.',
'During the rise of the republican communes the Imperial nobility waned. In order to meet this changing system, a consortium would seek security by forming around a single house or clan. In many ways this was an excellent solution to the problem of rival famiglia and vendettas. The disruptive violence of the corrupt signoria could be overcome by a single family gathering into a form of corporation, bound by blood. Each Domus was usually a crossbreeding of two partners. An old noble family (often through the mother) leant pedigree and land claims to the clan, whilst the other partner would usually be a nouveau riche Signori who had been quick and successful in seizing power. The consortia distributed power and wealth from the hands of one individual signor across the clan so that assassinations, scandals and commercial failures had a dampened effect on the family’s supremacy.',
'With enough luck to avoid the focus of vendettas from rival famiglia, noble houses could come to dominate a city’s politics. More than mere Mafioso, these families were true aristocrats with more strength in their breed of oligarchy than the rival merchants, guilds and bankers. These aristocrats had their own money anyway, but more than the merchants they had the appearance of actual nobility, and in the medieval world that counted for a great deal.',
'From among the nobles a select and trusted few from the most well-established famiglia have now been granted the power to form council over the city. They regulate taxes, trade, laws and even govern the military. Naturally they serve their own noble houses as well as the people. These Consuli would act as patrons, investing their own money into public amenities, improving housing and living conditions as well as the cultural life of the city. They were the guardians of the republic, as well as the puppet-masters.',
'From among the famiglia one has been chosen to act as chairman, the ‘power’ was a form of judge he was set up in order to mediate between the rival ‘consular families’ since rivalry could tear a city state in two. A podestat enabled the nobles to consolidate their differences and work together as a unified faction.',
'Populo governments were the reign of the ‘free people’, but in fact gave the merchant houses considerable power, for they were the driving force behind the new republics. The priori, was a kind of forum for the Signori and rival famiglia to meet face to face and politically fight out their commercial wars. Priori were usually built by the guilds, and so money rather than public duty was the prime concern in these courts. Commerce was improved, but at the cost of violent rivalry.',
'A ‘society of the people’ was a commoners’ government. This was the formal accession and organisation of a republican free commune. It represents the total freedom from Imperial feudalism and the arrival of the merchant houses as the new nobility.',
'‘First People’ was the Republic Government in a refined form, assigning a ‘captain’ or chairman from among their ranks, it was a democratic system very similar to our modern governments where presidents and prime ministers are voted in from among the wealthy and powerful mercantile elite.',
'The Merchant Houses have become the total and dominant force in the republic. Not only aristocrats, but Grand Magnates.',

'An association sworn to maintianing peace and upholding the common good. Usually they had no fixed memberhsip or meeting place and were to all intents and purposes a remnant of the Graeco-Roman pastoral communities made up of citizen members and ''clan chiefs'' of the various famiglia. It was a very basic form of senate, republic or Commune and the ancient foundation of Italian government and society.',
'A basic town assembly. A region usually had a natural point of control at a common centre such as a town that served as a crossroads for trade. The marketplace of a region usually became the forum for local government because laws and taxes could be decided where commerce thrived, it was a neutral zone between the rival gentry. From here militias could be formed, and a more efficient running of construction, trade and farming.',
'An organisation that dominates the surrrounding towns, villages and potentially even branch out from its own region to become part of a league of cities. A Commune was basically a society of nobles from various towns that had become a community. Typically in medieval times, the Commune was centred on a city, the Commune thereby asserted repsonsibility for the government of the surrounding contadi as a regional capital. From the 11th century most Communes were seen as independent city states, that were not only autonomous and self-governing but were dominant and aggressive factional seats that could colonise and subjugate rivals.',
'Contadi were administrative bodies that governed surrounding villages and estates, made up of the heads of numerous landowning families, these wealthy farmers were the largest employers in their area, they owned the land that was rented out to free tenants and they typically set the price and value of all commodities. A Contado acted as an autonomous organisation of aggregate that was usually subordinate to a Contado, city state or fiefdom. Prior to the emergence of the free Communes in Italy, contadi were the ''cashflow'' and tributaries under a marquisate. As the power of the marquises wained, contadi were in a position to be self-sufficient and had the potential to grow into independent states themselves.',
'Basically a regional capital. However, the major city states are of Capital status, dominating entire parts of Italy and beyond. Given such rights they have excellent financial strength and development options, however the local leadership is likely to want to be independent of its foreign masters. Therefore, if you have more cities than your actual faction capital designated as a Capitulo you will find it hard to control them. A Capitulo represents the core of an independent City State. A Capitulo is a powerful centre for commerce, politics and military assets but it requires a high level of government control that will have to adapt to the needs of the age and the situation of the nobles that make up the poltical groups based in that city. Although Capituli can be great features of your faction, they cannot be allowed to become greater than your actual capital. A Capitulo may grant a Podesta, Capitano Del Populo or even a Duke. Since your faction leader cannot hold the title of Capitano, Podesta or Duke of more than one city- it must go to another noble. If this other figure has greater authority than your Faction Leader it will surely spell civil war. Beware.',

building_desc_novgorod: [
'A wall of sharpened stakes gives some security, stops livestock from straying and may delay a thief, but cannot hold out real attackers for very long. It is, however, cheap to build and doesn''t require any special skills from the local peasants.',
'A rough wall of logs is a good deal stronger than a palisade and is enough to keep out bandits and other ruffians, but it still won''t stop a really determined and organised attack. It does give a settlement a sense of permanence and identity, though.',
'Stone walls are substantial replacements for stakes and logs, as their cost shows. Better yet, they can be actively defended by warriors occupying the parapets, meaning only determined attackers can breach them with artillery fire or fight their way over them.',
'Large stone walls include strong towers and gatehouses, and give a real sense of security to a settlement. Properly manned, only a really organised attack will stand a chance of breaching these defences. Because of the expense, these walls are usually only built around rich or prestigious towns.',

'This land has been claimed directly by the Velikiy Knyaz, all military and civilian developments are fully within his control.',
'Veche –tribal council, a basic assembly for major towns from which a fledgling state could develop controlling a wider area.',
'Pomestie - "service landholding," was a parcel of land (hopefully inhabited by rent-paying peasants, later serfs in exchange for which the holder (not owner) had to render lifelong service to the state, typically military service, but occasionally service in the government bureaucracy. Ideally, when the service ended, the landholder had to surrender the pomestie to another serviceman. The pomestie was granted for use only to support the serviceman and his family (including slaves) by peasant rent payments to him in lieu of cash. This was similar to western feudalism such as sergeantry. This system granted law, and a large source of tax and agriculture since the state controlled all aspects of government.',
'Council of Lords, the executive organ of the Novgorodian and Pskovian veches. Usually made up by former and serving Posadniks, Tysyatskys and Boyars it was led by a high serving member of the clergy such as an Archbishop, and in this way was meant to represent a more republican government.',
'Suburbs, literally "ends", historically these were the five boroughs into which medieval Novgorod the Great was divided. They were based on the three original settlements that combined to form the city. It is believed that the decisions of the all-city veche had to be ratified by the Veches of each End. It is also thought that each End governed one of the Fifths, the five organized territories into which the Novgorodian Land had been divided.',
'This land has been granted to a lord in feudal service of a greater Knyaz, this vassalage allows good military structure, and economic infrastructure but direct control is limited.',
'Rada –council or assembly. In basic terms it meant the magnates of a territory were gathered and could be more readily authorityd by a single authority such as a rising prince.',
'Votchina -patrimonial lands, from the word ’father’, was an East Slavic land estate that could be inherited. The term "votchina" was also used to describe the lands of a knyaz. The term originated in the law of Kievan Rus. An owner of votchina not only had property rights to it, but also some administrative and legal power over people living on its territory. These people, however, were not serfs, as they had a right to freely move to different votchinas. This was similar to the western freeholdings or villeinry. It was popular among the people but did not provide a great deal of income from agriculture since there was no strict and formal taxation.',
'Feudal rule, this was part of a larger social and political move of the entire nation. In this system, a noble was appointed to a service position on the basis of their family’s rank. The state also developed a census taking, and an organized military during this period of development, historically it has been seen as a very harsh form of government, it was very popular after the reclamation of lands from the Mongols. It provided a great amount of law and tax control but was very unpopular among the masses.',

'An association sworn to maintianing peace and upholding the common good. Usually they had no fixed memberhsip or meeting place and were to all intents and purposes a remnant of the Graeco-Roman pastoral communities made up of citizen members and ''clan chiefs'' of the various famiglia. It was a very basic form of senate, republic or Commune and the ancient foundation of Italian government and society.',
'A basic town assembly. A region usually had a natural point of control at a common centre such as a town that served as a crossroads for trade. The marketplace of a region usually became the forum for local government because laws and taxes could be decided where commerce thrived, it was a neutral zone between the rival gentry. From here militias could be formed, and a more efficient running of construction, trade and farming.',
'An organisation that dominates the surrrounding towns, villages and potentially even branch out from its own region to become part of a league of cities. A Commune was basically a society of nobles from various towns that had become a community. Typically in medieval times, the Commune was centred on a city, the Commune thereby asserted repsonsibility for the government of the surrounding contadi as a regional capital. From the 11th century most Communes were seen as independent city states, that were not only autonomous and self-governing but were dominant and aggressive factional seats that could colonise and subjugate rivals.',
'Contadi were administrative bodies that governed surrounding villages and estates, made up of the heads of numerous landowning families, these wealthy farmers were the largest employers in their area, they owned the land that was rented out to free tenants and they typically set the price and value of all commodities. A Contado acted as an autonomous organisation of aggregate that was usually subordinate to a Contado, city state or fiefdom. Prior to the emergence of the free Communes in Italy, contadi were the ''cashflow'' and tributaries under a marquisate. As the power of the marquises wained, contadi were in a position to be self-sufficient and had the potential to grow into independent states themselves.',
'Basically a regional capital. However, the major city states are of Capital status, dominating entire parts of Italy and beyond. Given such rights they have excellent financial strength and development options, however the local leadership is likely to want to be independent of its foreign masters. Therefore, if you have more cities than your actual faction capital designated as a Capitulo you will find it hard to control them. A Capitulo represents the core of an independent City State. A Capitulo is a powerful centre for commerce, politics and military assets but it requires a high level of government control that will have to adapt to the needs of the age and the situation of the nobles that make up the poltical groups based in that city. Although Capituli can be great features of your faction, they cannot be allowed to become greater than your actual capital. A Capitulo may grant a Podesta, Capitano Del Populo or even a Duke. Since your faction leader cannot hold the title of Capitano, Podesta or Duke of more than one city- it must go to another noble. If this other figure has greater authority than your Faction Leader it will surely spell civil war. Beware.',

'Sesti were city quarters, they were policed by a lottery of freemen all of whom had shift duties in militia patrols, maintaining their own part of the city walls, as well as acting as a fire department. Men of each sesti even made up sports teams and wore specific colours, similar to rival football teams, backing these gangs the city quarters would often riot against each other, proud of their own streets. The different districts, such as the harbour district, or banking district would all have their own mafia houses or ‘famiglia’ run by Signori the masters of these clans. Signoria were the godfathers and represented the merchants, bankers, artisan guilds and nobles that all competed in cutthroat conspiracies to dominate the city and undermine their rivals. Although a real boost to urban pride and culture it was a dangerous underworld, it was also the foundation for future republican government and the start of the oligarchies.',
'During the rise of the republican communes the Imperial nobility waned. In order to meet this changing system, a consortium would seek security by forming around a single house or clan. In many ways this was an excellent solution to the problem of rival famiglia and vendettas. The disruptive violence of the corrupt signoria could be overcome by a single family gathering into a form of corporation, bound by blood. Each Domus was usually a crossbreeding of two partners. An old noble family (often through the mother) leant pedigree and land claims to the clan, whilst the other partner would usually be a nouveau riche Signori who had been quick and successful in seizing power. The consortia distributed power and wealth from the hands of one individual signor across the clan so that assassinations, scandals and commercial failures had a dampened effect on the family’s supremacy.',
'With enough luck to avoid the focus of vendettas from rival famiglia, noble houses could come to dominate a city’s politics. More than mere Mafioso, these families were true aristocrats with more strength in their breed of oligarchy than the rival merchants, guilds and bankers. These aristocrats had their own money anyway, but more than the merchants they had the appearance of actual nobility, and in the medieval world that counted for a great deal.',
'From among the nobles a select and trusted few from the most well-established famiglia have now been granted the power to form council over the city. They regulate taxes, trade, laws and even govern the military. Naturally they serve their own noble houses as well as the people. These Consuli would act as patrons, investing their own money into public amenities, improving housing and living conditions as well as the cultural life of the city. They were the guardians of the republic, as well as the puppet-masters.',
'From among the famiglia one has been chosen to act as chairman, the ‘power’ was a form of judge he was set up in order to mediate between the rival ‘consular families’ since rivalry could tear a city state in two. A podestat enabled the nobles to consolidate their differences and work together as a unified faction.',
'Populo governments were the reign of the ‘free people’, but in fact gave the merchant houses considerable power, for they were the driving force behind the new republics. The priori, was a kind of forum for the Signori and rival famiglia to meet face to face and politically fight out their commercial wars. Priori were usually built by the guilds, and so money rather than public duty was the prime concern in these courts. Commerce was improved, but at the cost of violent rivalry.',
'A ‘society of the people’ was a commoners’ government. This was the formal accession and organisation of a republican free commune. It represents the total freedom from Imperial feudalism and the arrival of the merchant houses as the new nobility.',
'‘First People’ was the Republic Government in a refined form, assigning a ‘captain’ or chairman from among their ranks, it was a democratic system very similar to our modern governments where presidents and prime ministers are voted in from among the wealthy and powerful mercantile elite.',
'The Merchant Houses have become the total and dominant force in the republic. Not only aristocrats, but Grand Magnates.',

'An association sworn to maintianing peace and upholding the common good. Usually they had no fixed memberhsip or meeting place and were to all intents and purposes a remnant of the Graeco-Roman pastoral communities made up of citizen members and ''clan chiefs'' of the various famiglia. It was a very basic form of senate, republic or Commune and the ancient foundation of Italian government and society.',
'A basic town assembly. A region usually had a natural point of control at a common centre such as a town that served as a crossroads for trade. The marketplace of a region usually became the forum for local government because laws and taxes could be decided where commerce thrived, it was a neutral zone between the rival gentry. From here militias could be formed, and a more efficient running of construction, trade and farming.',
'An organisation that dominates the surrrounding towns, villages and potentially even branch out from its own region to become part of a league of cities. A Commune was basically a society of nobles from various towns that had become a community. Typically in medieval times, the Commune was centred on a city, the Commune thereby asserted repsonsibility for the government of the surrounding contadi as a regional capital. From the 11th century most Communes were seen as independent city states, that were not only autonomous and self-governing but were dominant and aggressive factional seats that could colonise and subjugate rivals.',
'Contadi were administrative bodies that governed surrounding villages and estates, made up of the heads of numerous landowning families, these wealthy farmers were the largest employers in their area, they owned the land that was rented out to free tenants and they typically set the price and value of all commodities. A Contado acted as an autonomous organisation of aggregate that was usually subordinate to a Contado, city state or fiefdom. Prior to the emergence of the free Communes in Italy, contadi were the ''cashflow'' and tributaries under a marquisate. As the power of the marquises wained, contadi were in a position to be self-sufficient and had the potential to grow into independent states themselves.',
'Basically a regional capital. However, the major city states are of Capital status, dominating entire parts of Italy and beyond. Given such rights they have excellent financial strength and development options, however the local leadership is likely to want to be independent of its foreign masters. Therefore, if you have more cities than your actual faction capital designated as a Capitulo you will find it hard to control them. A Capitulo represents the core of an independent City State. A Capitulo is a powerful centre for commerce, politics and military assets but it requires a high level of government control that will have to adapt to the needs of the age and the situation of the nobles that make up the poltical groups based in that city. Although Capituli can be great features of your faction, they cannot be allowed to become greater than your actual capital. A Capitulo may grant a Podesta, Capitano Del Populo or even a Duke. Since your faction leader cannot hold the title of Capitano, Podesta or Duke of more than one city- it must go to another noble. If this other figure has greater authority than your Faction Leader it will surely spell civil war. Beware.',

'Conscription represents the call to arms in a region, where the ruler raises a national army for rapid deployment. Conscription buildings allow European factions to quickly gain access to a wide range of units without the need for a developed military infrastucture such as stables, barracks or bowyers. Instead, each tier of the conscription allows a mix of unit types dependent on social class. The higher the conscription level the more elite and noble the units available. Be careful however, conscription was extremely unpopular with the people, and should only be used in emergencies for defence or summoning large armies for a campaign. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands! This level requires Provincial Charters, and allows access to levies from the countryside.',
'Conscription level 2 allows access to units of militia level, usually from town guards or peasant classes. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands!',
'Conscription level 3 ties in with Sergeantry, and allows access to the lower nolbility and man-at-arms class of units. REMEMBER: destroy the conscription building when you finished with that level, continue to build the next level if the law and order in the settlement allows you to, and you can recruit better units (if you can afford them), HOWEVER if you fail to destroy the building- you will have a rebellion on your hands!',

'The Catholics take possession of the land, after conquest from Taifa states and Muslims. They would naturally convert the old inhabitants, but also seek to bring in fresh blood, and their own culture. This phase would normally involve Scalio (cultivation) of the land, irrigation and designation of ownership. There was also the process of Cartae Populationis (censors and charters) which gave land grants to new colonists but also acted as a binding contract with the feudal lords to better facilitate the extraction of taxes.',
'Fuero is related to the Latin word ''forum''. There were a range of fuero, such as fuero militar, a military code of justice or fuero eclesiástico, relating to the Church. These were basically a more well-defined issue of law and charters, calling in the debts of the initial boom of grants. On the other hand, fueros could also be written to entitle the region to keep its old or uniquely regional laws perhaps representing the pecularities of population or customs.',
'A Concejo is the most direct continuation of the fuero, it is the creation of new municipalities, once given a royal concession by the fueros. The concejos can be created in cities with large Moorish population and will generally be a means to financially maximise the potential of those settlements that have already reached a good population size. Law and Order can be a problem in these settlements however, but normally income is very good.',
'This encourages a military order to take over government of the region. This has several benefits despite giving up much of the land to support the knights and the military, which means a lose of revenue. The knights increase religious conversion and they also enforce laws and taxes, although the money usually pays for their recruitment of new units. A military order offers some of the best military units available and although they can be quite demanding and require the sacrifice of many other potential benefits of crown ownership, they make up for this in self-sufficiency.',
'By granting land to specific nobles, you increase their power which can be dangerous or beneficial depending on what you have planned for the character. A noble will generally require autonomy which means that you will not have control over recruitment or construction but you can expect that the settlement will be run effiiciently without requiring your intervention, ....that is as long as the noble in question can be kept in check.',

'The Catholics take possession of the land, after conquest from Taifa states and Muslims. They would naturally convert the old inhabitants, but also seek to bring in fresh blood, and their own culture.',
'Fuero is related to the Latin word ''forum''. There were a range of fuero, such as fuero militar, a military code of justice or fuero eclesiástico, relating to the Church. These were basically a more well-defined issue of law and charters, calling in the debts of the initial boom of grants.',
'A Concejo is the most direct continuation of the fuero, it is the creation of new municipalities, once given a royal concession by the fueros. The concejos can be created in cities with large Moorish population and will generally be a means to financially maximise the potential of those settlements that have already reached a good population size. Law and Order can be a problem in these settlements however, but normally income is very good.',
'This encourages a military order to take over government of the region. This has several benefits despite giving up much of the land to support the knights and the military, which means a lose of revenue.',
'By granting land to specific nobles, you increase their power which can be dangerous or beneficial depending on what you have planned for the character.',

'Laws of the Freemen were an old Gaelic institution which represented the tribal rights of the middle classes in the face of earls or kings. It constituted basic land tenure freedoms and an avoidance of levies and heavier policing which in turn prevented generic order.',
'Literally ''kin land'', this was the freeman clan''s right to hold the land and regulate it hereditarily. This meant in effect that a region was not only autonomous but free in a very real sense, run by clan-law and defended by clans. This was far from a utopia however, since it left the land open to raids and clan warfare.',
'An ancient Gaelic unit of land similar to the English ''hundred'' although in reality it came to represented not the measure but the power of a chief that controlled these plots of farmland, it was a form of land claim by what were in effect barons or clan chiefs.',
'Gave the right to settle the land to which the chiefs and leading gentry provided protection and authority as trustees for the people. It was to all intents and purposes a kind of clan republic rather than a feudal state governed by a Count.',
'An ancient Gaelic system of common army service, whereby the region acknowledges its position as a subject of the kingdom with responsibilities to take part in Royal campaigns and aid in the defence of the realm. It was unpopular since it called in the debt that was owing to the king for enabling a free district. Unfortunately the clans would often see themselves as having a right to freedom and independence and would dispute the king’s requests. Raising troops would disrupt local farming, trade and tear families apart. Whilst men left their homesteads it allowed bandits to roam free although these two were undermined by the assembly and patrol of troops.',
'The chieftain''s authority came from charters granted by the feudal Scottish crown, where individual heritage was warranted. A chieftain was a form of knight, in that he would become a semi-autonomous lord, put his people to the plough and run the district as he saw fit. Giving levies to the king directly he was also due him feudal service but in return received protection in military matters and aid in commerce.',
'A tribute paid several times a year, usually in cattle and other barter goods. This was a formal contract between the King and his vassals, which would serve to supplement the king’s table using his chieftain’s domains as an extension of his own estates. It was unpopular but often helped to remind his vassals who was in charge. It also helped fill the coffers, even if it meant taking food from the mouths of peasants.',
'A periodical tribute to the king as he ranged across his domains keeping order and governing development, receiving taxes, levies and controlling infrastructure, as well as feasting. It was an ancient practice, one that can be seen illustrated in Macbeth.',
'This was the establishment of private retinues which not only served the nobility but formed elements of the national army’s elite forces. It stabilised the different regions allowing a far more efficient means of controlling not only the populace of each region but of ensuring that the counts kept each other in check. The retinues added defences against invaders and also from brigandage. However the permission to keep large forces was often abused by the lords, increasing their ability to extract illegal ‘private’ taxes from the peasantry and tempt some to challenge the king himself.',

'Laws of the Freemen were an old Gaelic institution which represented the tribal rights of the middle classes in the face of earls or kings. It constituted basic land tenure freedoms and an avoidance of levies and heavier policing which in turn prevented generic order.',
'Literally ''kin land'', this was the freeman clan''s right to hold the land and regulate it hereditarily. This meant in effect that a region was not only autonomous but free in a very real sense, run by clan-law and defended by clans. This was far from a utopia however, since it left the land open to raids and clan warfare.',
'An ancient Gaelic unit of land similar to the English ''hundred'' although in reality it came to represented not the measure but the power of a chief that controlled these plots of farmland, it was a form of land claim by what were in effect barons or clan chiefs.',
'Gave the right to settle the land to which the chiefs and leading gentry provided protection and authority as trustees for the people. It was to all intents and purposes a kind of clan republic rather than a feudal state governed by a Count.',
'An ancient Gaelic system of common army service, whereby the region acknowledges its position as a subject of the kingdom with responsibilities to take part in Royal campaigns and aid in the defence of the realm. It was unpopular since it called in the debt that was owing to the king for enabling a free district.',
'The chieftain''s authority came from charters granted by the feudal Scottish crown, where individual heritage was warranted. A chieftain was a form of knight, in that he would become a semi-autonomous lord, put his people to the plough and run the district as he saw fit. Giving levies to the king directly he was also due him feudal service but in return received protection in military matters and aid in commerce.',
'A tribute paid several times a year, usually in cattle and other barter goods. This was a formal contract between the King and his vassals, which would serve to supplement the king’s table using his chieftain’s domains as an extension of his own estates. It was unpopular but often helped to remind his vassals who was in charge.',
'A periodical tribute to the king as he ranged across his domains keeping order and governing development, receiving taxes, levies and controlling infrastructure, as well as feasting. It was an ancient practice, one that can be seen illustrated in Macbeth.',
'This was the establishment of private retinues which not only served the nobility but formed elements of the national army’s elite forces. It stabilised the different regions allowing a far more efficient means of controlling not only the populace of each region but of ensuring that the counts kept each other in check. The retinues added defences against invaders and also from brigandage.',

'Nomadising, nomadic life, nomad camp. Gathering a group to go on the move was more difficult than just going on the move as a family, as nomads- the basic foundation of tribal kinship was the most essential building block of society. However organising a non-urbanised group into a socially-conscious force, designated as the core of a small settlement took some deliberate time and money to encourage.',
'Encampment, site of a camp, foundation of a yurt. A recognised settlement-site was for nomads, an organisation that required money and planning. For nomads, a settlement was a point to return to regularly- not a point to stand and stay. To return to a point, it would be a recognised and well-developed trading point, a pre-ordained and well-known crossroads for traffic where festivals, taxation, military organisation and law would all be focussed. But the foundation of a gathering of yurts was a very simple operation for a nomadic people, it just required incentive.',
'Station, camp, inn, halt, stop. A recognised gathering point for the nomads would draw them from afar if there was an infrastructure to pull them in, if trade would be worthwhile and guaranteed. The problem for the majority of nomads in moving to and fro well-known sites was the danger to banditry and raids from rival clans or tribes. If a settlement could guarantee the security of the outlying area then the caravans would come.',
'Hamlet of yurts, place of assembly of people of the same rank. Nomads could consider a settlement or camp as a well-established centre of power if the heads of various clans and tribes had gathered at the same point and could live in peace and agreement. Only under an authoritative figure of a great khan could this be achieved. ',
'Consisted of 1,000 tent-families. To maintain such an economy the Mongol cattle-raisers had to move from place to place in separate ail or families. In the conditions of feudal division and internecine strife, the huree or ring-shaped disposition of families was widely used as a means of defence against surprise attack. The leader''s tent was in the centre. According to Rashid-ad-Din, every huree consisted of 1,000 tent-families.',

However the Steppe nomads, especially the Mongols were more than capable of developing infrastructure that used traditional routes and established an organised official imperial network along these routes.',

'Ovoo (hill), heap or cairn, is the equivalent of a shaman''s shrine (altar). This is a heap of bones or stone formed by man. They would be inhabited by spirits of the locality, local deities (nibdagh and shiddagh) of the Mongolian people. When passing by an ovoo, travellers are required to walk around it three times (clockwise) and place a rock on it. By doing this, they symbolically add to the spirit’s power, as by adding the rock he receives energy for his windhorse (personal psychic power) and good luck for his journey. Ovoo are also the place of several ceremonies during the year which nearby families or clans would celebrate in honor of the local spirit as well as Father Heaven and Mother Earth and other shaman spirits. Mountain spirits and other powerful Gazriin Ezen are worshipped at these special shrines.',
'The barisaa (prayer tree - shrine) is an important site of worship. This ritual brings peace and reduces violence in whatever place it is performed in. It needs to be done in as many places as possible, especially in places that were sites of deaths because of war or violence. It also calls the nature spirits to bring inspiration, calm people''s hearts, and create thoughts of peace and love. This is the act of performing ariulga, this is cleansing your soul from the evil nature spirits. The ritual for the calming (reducing of negative energy) of the spirits will have a permanent effect from which all people in the community where it is done, not only the participants, will benefit. The tree has now become a barisaa, a shaman shrine for the nature spirits. A tree symbolizes the world center, where Heaven and earth touch, where all times and places converge. They may be honored by tying on pieces of cloth. The lone birch, the "shaman tree", is called ongonmodon, for these trees are believed to be the home of the shamans'' helper spirits, Ongon. Trees are also symbolic of the World Tree, which is usually visualized as a birch or willow.',
'Another type of ritual tree is the serge, which is made from a young birch. Some of them were once souls of human beings, ancestors from a time so long ago. A mountain or tree of great majesty will be said to have suld, which is the same word that is used to refer to the soul which remains in nature after death. Unusual rocks or trees are believed to have a strong spirit and are respected or given offerings of tobacco or liquor. Mountain spirits are considered to be very powerful, and are prayed to in order to provide good hunting and abundance of natural food plants. These ceremonies are usually held roughly around the times of the equinoxes and solstices and are usually performed by the elders of the local clan or tribe.',

For nomads, a settlement was a point to return to regularly- not a point to stand and stay. To return to a point, it would be a recognised and well-developed trading point, a pre-ordained and well-known crossroads for traffic where festivals, taxation, military organisation and law would all be focussed. But the foundation of a gathering of yurts was a very simple operation for a nomadic people, it just required incentive.',
'Station, camp, inn, halt, stop. A recognised gathering point for the nomads would draw them from afar if there was an infrastructure to pull them in, if trade would be worthwhile and guaranteed. The problem for the majority of nomads in moving to and fro well-known sites was the danger to banditry and raids from rival clans or tribes. If a settlement could guarantee the security of the outlying area then the caravans would come.',

'Ovoo (hill), heap or cairn, is the equivalent of a shaman''s shrine (altar). This is a heap of bones or stone formed by man. They would be inhabited by spirits of the locality, local deities (nibdagh and shiddagh) of the Mongolian people.',
'The barisaa (prayer tree - shrine) is an important site of worship. This ritual brings peace and reduces violence in whatever place it is performed in. It needs to be done in as many places as possible, especially in places that were sites of deaths because of war or violence. It also calls the nature spirits to bring inspiration, calm people''s hearts, and create thoughts of peace and love.',
'Another type of ritual tree is the serge, which is made from a young birch. Some of them were once souls of human beings, ancestors from a time so long ago. A mountain or tree of great majesty will be said to have suld, which is the same word that is used to refer to the soul which remains in nature after death. Unusual rocks or trees are believed to have a strong spirit and are respected or given offerings of tobacco or liquor.',

'The exterior trade of Castilla and León started to develop in the XIII century, thanks to the intiative of Cantabric and Basque sailors. In the end of the XII century foreign fabrics entered the Peninsula through the port of Santander, who, together with Castro Urdiales, Laredo and San Vicente de la Barquera, formed the Villas de la Marina de Castilla.',
'The Villas de la Marina, joined by Bermeo, San Sebastián, Fuenterrabía and Guetaria, formed the Hermandad de las Marismas, which was a federation of cities with freedom of trade and relations with Flanders, France and England (sometimes engaging those in combat), something like a Castillian Hansa. Their main objectives were to preserve their priviledges, to respect the international agreements of Castilla, to seek solutions for conflicts between the villages in the Brotherhood and defend themselves against their common enemies. Ships of the Hermandad participated in the Hundred Years War (helping the French) and the English War of the Roses.',
'The Universidad de Mercaderes was a trade association of Castillian and Vizcayan businessmen, whose aim was to defend and promote the interests of its members. In 1443 the first Universidad de Mercaderes was built in Burgos motivated by the needs of the wool trade, and in 1489 the University of Merchants Vizcayans, or the University of Sailors was built in Bilbao, both with the same character. They soon expanded their range by becoming the backbone of the naval and commercial power of Castilla in Europe.',

'The Catholics take possession of the land, after conquest from Taifa states and Muslims. They would naturally convert the old inhabitants, but also seek to bring in fresh blood, and their own culture. This phase would normally involve Scalio (cultivation) of the land, irrigation and designation of ownership. There was also the process of Cartae Populationis (censors and charters) which gave land grants to new colonists but also acted as a binding contract with the feudal lords to better facilitate the extraction of taxes.',
'Fuero is related to the Latin word ''forum''. There were a range of fuero, such as fuero militar, a military code of justice or fuero eclesiástico, relating to the Church. These were basically a more well-defined issue of law and charters, calling in the debts of the initial boom of grants. On the other hand, fueros could also be written to entitle the region to keep its old or uniquely regional laws perhaps representing the pecularities of population or customs.',
'A Concejo is the most direct continuation of the fuero, it is the creation of new municipalities, once given a royal concession by the fueros. The concejos can be created in cities with large Moorish population and will generally be a means to financially maximise the potential of those settlements that have already reached a good population size. Law and Order can be a problem in these settlements however, but normally income is very good.',
'This encourages a military order to take over government of the region. This has several benefits despite giving up much of the land to support the knights and the military, which means a lose of revenue. The knights increase religious conversion and they also enforce laws and taxes, although the money usually pays for their recruitment of new units. A military order offers some of the best military units available and although they can be quite demanding and require the sacrifice of many other potential benefits of crown ownership, they make up for this in self-sufficiency.',
'By granting land to specific nobles, you increase their power which can be dangerous or beneficial depending on what you have planned for the character. A noble will generally require autonomy which means that you will not have control over recruitment or construction but you can expect that the settlement will be run effiiciently without requiring your intervention, ....that is as long as the noble in question can be kept in check.',

'Sesti were city quarters, they were policed by a lottery of freemen all of whom had shift duties in militia patrols, maintaining their own part of the city walls, as well as acting as a fire department. Men of each sesti even made up sports teams and wore specific colours, similar to rival football teams, backing these gangs the city quarters would often riot against each other, proud of their own streets. The different districts, such as the harbour district, or banking district would all have their own mafia houses or ‘famiglia’ run by Signori the masters of these clans. Signoria were the godfathers and represented the merchants, bankers, artisan guilds and nobles that all competed in cutthroat conspiracies to dominate the city and undermine their rivals. Although a real boost to urban pride and culture it was a dangerous underworld, it was also the foundation for future republican government and the start of the oligarchies.',
'During the rise of the republican communes the Imperial nobility waned. In order to meet this changing system, a consortium would seek security by forming around a single house or clan. In many ways this was an excellent solution to the problem of rival famiglia and vendettas. The disruptive violence of the corrupt signoria could be overcome by a single family gathering into a form of corporation, bound by blood. Each Domus was usually a crossbreeding of two partners. An old noble family (often through the mother) leant pedigree and land claims to the clan, whilst the other partner would usually be a nouveau riche Signori who had been quick and successful in seizing power. The consortia distributed power and wealth from the hands of one individual signor across the clan so that assassinations, scandals and commercial failures had a dampened effect on the family’s supremacy.',
'With enough luck to avoid the focus of vendettas from rival famiglia, noble houses could come to dominate a city’s politics. More than mere Mafioso, these families were true aristocrats with more strength in their breed of oligarchy than the rival merchants, guilds and bankers. These aristocrats had their own money anyway, but more than the merchants they had the appearance of actual nobility, and in the medieval world that counted for a great deal.',
'From among the nobles a select and trusted few from the most well-established famiglia have now been granted the power to form council over the city. They regulate taxes, trade, laws and even govern the military. Naturally they serve their own noble houses as well as the people. These Consuli would act as patrons, investing their own money into public amenities, improving housing and living conditions as well as the cultural life of the city. They were the guardians of the republic, as well as the puppet-masters.',
'From among the famiglia one has been chosen to act as chairman, the ‘power’ was a form of judge he was set up in order to mediate between the rival ‘consular families’ since rivalry could tear a city state in two. A podestat enabled the nobles to consolidate their differences and work together as a unified faction.',
'Populo governments were the reign of the ‘free people’, but in fact gave the merchant houses considerable power, for they were the driving force behind the new republics. The priori, was a kind of forum for the Signori and rival famiglia to meet face to face and politically fight out their commercial wars. Priori were usually built by the guilds, and so money rather than public duty was the prime concern in these courts. Commerce was improved, but at the cost of violent rivalry.',
'A ‘society of the people’ was a commoners’ government. This was the formal accession and organisation of a republican free commune. It represents the total freedom from Imperial feudalism and the arrival of the merchant houses as the new nobility.',
'‘First People’ was the Republic Government in a refined form, assigning a ‘captain’ or chairman from among their ranks, it was a democratic system very similar to our modern governments where presidents and prime ministers are voted in from among the wealthy and powerful mercantile elite.',
'The Merchant Houses have become the total and dominant force in the republic. Not only aristocrats, but Grand Magnates.',

'An association sworn to maintianing peace and upholding the common good. Usually they had no fixed memberhsip or meeting place and were to all intents and purposes a remnant of the Graeco-Roman pastoral communities made up of citizen members and ''clan chiefs'' of the various famiglia. It was a very basic form of senate, republic or Commune and the ancient foundation of Italian government and society.',
'A basic town assembly. A region usually had a natural point of control at a common centre such as a town that served as a crossroads for trade. The marketplace of a region usually became the forum for local government because laws and taxes could be decided where commerce thrived, it was a neutral zone between the rival gentry. From here militias could be formed, and a more efficient running of construction, trade and farming.',
'An organisation that dominates the surrrounding towns, villages and potentially even branch out from its own region to become part of a league of cities. A Commune was basically a society of nobles from various towns that had become a community. Typically in medieval times, the Commune was centred on a city, the Commune thereby asserted repsonsibility for the government of the surrounding contadi as a regional capital. From the 11th century most Communes were seen as independent city states, that were not only autonomous and self-governing but were dominant and aggressive factional seats that could colonise and subjugate rivals.',
'Contadi were administrative bodies that governed surrounding villages and estates, made up of the heads of numerous landowning families, these wealthy farmers were the largest employers in their area, they owned the land that was rented out to free tenants and they typically set the price and value of all commodities. A Contado acted as an autonomous organisation of aggregate that was usually subordinate to a Contado, city state or fiefdom. Prior to the emergence of the free Communes in Italy, contadi were the ''cashflow'' and tributaries under a marquisate. As the power of the marquises wained, contadi were in a position to be self-sufficient and had the potential to grow into independent states themselves.',
'Basically a regional capital. However, the major city states are of Capital status, dominating entire parts of Italy and beyond. Given such rights they have excellent financial strength and development options, however the local leadership is likely to want to be independent of its foreign masters. Therefore, if you have more cities than your actual faction capital designated as a Capitulo you will find it hard to control them. A Capitulo represents the core of an independent City State. A Capitulo is a powerful centre for commerce, politics and military assets but it requires a high level of government control that will have to adapt to the needs of the age and the situation of the nobles that make up the poltical groups based in that city. Although Capituli can be great features of your faction, they cannot be allowed to become greater than your actual capital. A Capitulo may grant a Podesta, Capitano Del Populo or even a Duke. Since your faction leader cannot hold the title of Capitano, Podesta or Duke of more than one city- it must go to another noble. If this other figure has greater authority than your Faction Leader it will surely spell civil war. Beware.',

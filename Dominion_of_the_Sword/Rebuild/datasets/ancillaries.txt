'Sancho Ramírez was King of Aragon from 1063 (though not formally until 1076) and King of Navarre (from 1076, as Sancho V). Between 1067 and 1068, the War of the Three Sanchos involved him in a conflict with his first cousins, both also named Sancho, in which Sancho of Castile defeated Sancho IV of Navarre and Sancho Ramírez, retaking a number of territories from the two. Sancho Ramírez followed his father''s practice of not using the royal title early in his reign, though his state had become fully independent. This changed in 1076, when Sancho IV of Navarre was murdered, prompting a succession crisis in this neighbouring kingdom that represented Aragon''s nominal overlord. The crisis was resolved by partition, and Sancho Ramírez was elected King of Navarre. From this time Sancho referred to himself as king not only of Navarre but also of Aragon.',
'Ermengol IV, called el de Gerb or Gerp, was the Count of Urgell from 1066. He was the son of Ermengol III and Clemencia, daughter of Bernard II of Bigorre. Ermengol inherited Urgell when he was only ten years old and ruled under the tutelage of the countess dowager, Sancha, third wife of his father, until he was twelve. During this brief minority, the nobility took the opportunity to plunder and occupy the comital demesne. It was not until 1075 that Ermengol was in control of his county and his nobles. Ermengol was an active count. During his reign Urgell profited economically by receiving exiles from Lleida and Fraga. Ermengol was a firm supporter of the contemporary Gregorian reform of the Church, which he introduced to Urgel. In 1077 Ermengol married Lucy, daughter of Bernard I of La Marche. With her he had his son and heir, Ermengol V. ',

'Philaretos Brachamios was a distinguished Byzantine general and warlord of Armenian heritage, and for a time was a usurper against Emperor Michael VII. Noted for his cruelty and greed, Philaretos held a high command in the army of Romanus IV Diogenes. In 1069 he was given the command of the main Byzantine army that was protecting the frontier of Mesopotamia while Romanus participated in the siege of Akhlat, but was defeated by the Turks who advanced deep into Cappadocia and Lycaonia. He was present at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, where he commanded a division of Romanus'' army, and remained at the head of a considerable body of troops after the disaster. In the aftermath of the battle, he commanded the forces of the fortress Romanopolis, and on Romanus'' death he assumed the title of Emperor. As the only remaining Byzantine general in the southeast he established a quasi-autonomous realm in the neighbourhood of Germanicia, which stretched from Cilicia to Edessa. In 1078 he agreed to abandon his imperial claims on condition that he be appointed duke of Antioch. ',
'Vratislav II ruled Bohemia from 1061. He was a strong ally of Emperor Henry IV. He supported Henry stalwartly in both the Investiture Controversy, despite his good relations with the Holy See and attempts by the Pope to gain his support, and against the rebellions in Saxony. During the Saxon revolt of 1071, Poland attacked Bohemia, and in August 1073 Henry responded with an invasion of Poland, but a new Saxon revolt drew him back in 1075. Vratislaus joined him, and they defeated the rebels on 9th June at the First Battle of Langensalza, with the Bohemian troops showing conspicuous bravery. Vratislaus also took part in the wars against the German Anti-kings. At the Battle of Flarchheim only through the aid of Vratislaus''s contingent was the imperial army capable of overcoming Rudolf of Rheinfelden. Vratislaus coveted the largely Slavic marches of Meissen and Lusatia, but, in spite of Henry''s promises, he never received them. Despite his serving an excommunicated emperor, Vratislaus maintained good relations with the papacy.',
'Ruben I was the first lord of Armenian Cilicia. Roupen was a commander in the armies of king Gagik II of Armenia. After the imprisonment of Gagik by Constantine IX, Roupen faithfully followed the king’s court into exile and resettled in the district of Caesarea in Cappadocia. However, upon the murder of Gagik II, Roupen gathered his family and fled to the Taurus Mountains, taking refuge in the fortress of Kopitar, the territory of the Armenians in the Taurus being hard of access and easy to defend. Roupen declared the independence of Cilicia from the Byzantine Empire in 1080. Relying mostly upon the remaining followers of King Gagik, he developed enough strength to descend gradually towards the heartland of the Cilician plain. He began leading bold and successful military campaigns against the Byzantines, topping his venture with the capture of the fortress of Pardzerpert which became a stronghold of the Roupenian dynasty. He became a vassal of Philaretos Brachamios, and together they greatly expanded the Armenian territories northward and eastward.',
'Abu Bakr ibn Umar was a chieftan of the Lamtuna Berbers of the Western Sahara, and commander of the Almoravids from 1056. Abu Bakr was brother of Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni, who with the Maliki teacher Abdallah ibn Yasin launched the Almoravid movement in the early 1050s. Upon the death of Yahya ibn Umar in 1056, the spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin appointed Abu Bakr as commander of the Almoravids. He led the conquest of the Sous valley of southern Morocco from 1057-8. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yasin, Abu Bakr, now the sole commander of the Almoravids, conquered the Berghwata in a brutal campaign of revenge. He received control without the pretence of religious authority, taking up the comparatively modest title of amir al-Muslimin ("Prince of the Muslims"). He married the wealthiest woman in Aghmat, Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat, who helped him navigate the complicated politics of southern Morocco. But Abu Bakr disliked courtly life and in 1060 left the city and pitched his tents on the pastures along the Tensift River, setting up an encampment for their headquarters, as if they were back in the Sahara desert. Stone buildings would eventually replace the tents, and the encampment would become the city of Marrakesh. Abu Bakr placed his cousin Yusuf ibn Tashfin in charge of Aghmat, and assigned him the responsibility of maintaining the northern front. Discontent had arisen in the Almoravid ranks, particularly among the desert clans back in the Sahara, and after the fall of Fez, Abu Bakr decided it was time to return to the Sahara. He placed Yusuf in charge of Morocco, divorcing Zaynab before he left, and advised her to marry Yusuf if she needed protection. By the time of his successful return in 1072, Yusuf was reluctant to give it up power. Pushed by his new wife, Zaynab, Yusuf met Abu Bakr and persuaded him to abdicate the northern dominions to him. Abu Bakr returned to the Sahara desert to command the southern armies, launching a new campaign against the Ghana Empire in 1076.',
'Alan Rufus ("Alan the Red") was a probable companion of William the Conqueror during the Norman Conquest and especially during Harrying of the North, in which he built Richmond Castle. He was the second son of Odo, Count of Penthièvre, by Agnes, daughter of Alain Cagnart, Count of Cornouaille, making him a cousin of William the Conqueror. He later became Earl of Richmond. His brother Brian was granted lands in Cornwall, but relinquished his own estates for a Breton wife and her dowry. At the time of his death, his wealth was noted as £11.000 (estimated at £81 billion in modern terms) and 7% of the net national income of England, making him the wealthiest Briton in history.',
'Anselm of Canterbury was a Benedictine monk, a philosopher, and a prelate of the church who held the office of Archbishop of Canterbury. Called the founder of scholasticism, he is famous as the originator of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Born into the noble family of Candia, he entered the Benedictine order at the Abbey of Bec at the age of twenty-seven, where he became abbot in 1079. He became Archbishop of Canterbury under William II of England. Anselm''s writings represent a recognition of the relationship of reason to revealed truth, and an attempt to elaborate a rational system of faith. ',
'Brian of Brittany was a Breton noble who fought for William I of England. He was the second (probably illegitimate) son of Odo, Count of Penthièvre, and brother of Alan Rufus. Brian is said to have commanded a band of Bretons with his brother at the Battle of Hastings.  At midsummer in 1069, Brian and Alan led a force that defeated a raid on Devon by Godwine and Edmund, sons of Harold Godwinson, who had sailed from Ireland where they were in exile. Later the same year, Brian and William fitz Osbern were sent to relieve sieges at Shrewsbury and Exeter by rebelling Englishmen. They were too late to save the former, but a sally by the defenders of Exeter drove the English into the path of Brian and William who "punished their audacity with great slaughter". Brian received grants of land in Suffolk and Cornwall. Brian''s name is often associated with the construction of Launceston Castle. He left England for Brittany following the rebellion of Ralph de Gaël in 1075. ',
'Eudes, Count of Champagne, was also Count of Troyes and of Meaux from 1047 to 1066, then Count of Aumale in Normandy from 1069 by right of his wife. He was still a minor at the death of his father, and his uncle Theobald III of Blois acted as regent of Troyes. His wife, Adelaide, was sister of William the Conqueror, and Eudes accompanied his brother-in-law in the Norman conquest of England. Theobald III of Blois then seized Eudes''s counties in the Champagne region. For his services, William gave Eudes Holderness in Yorkshire.',
'Eustace II was count of Boulogne and fought on the Norman side at the Battle of Hastings, and afterwards received a large honour in England. He is one of the few proven Companions of William the Conqueror. After joining the failed rebellion against Emperor Henry III in 1048 Eustace paid a visit to England in 1051, and was honourably received at Edward the Confessor''s court. A number of events during the decade evidently caused a shift in Eustace''s political allegiances, for he then became an important participant in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Sources suggest that Eustace was present with William at the Malfosse incident in the immediate aftermath of the battle, where a Saxon feigning death leapt up and attacked him, and was presumably cut down before he could reach William. In the following year, probably because he was dissatisfied with his share of the spoil, he assisted the Kentishmen in an attempt to seize Dover Castle. The conspiracy failed, and Eustace was sentenced to forfeit his English fiefs. Subsequently he was reconciled to the Conqueror, who restored a portion of the confiscated lands.',
'Geoffrey de Montbray was bishop of Coutances, a right-hand man of William the Conqueror, and was a great feudal prelate, warrior and administrator at need. He was present on the battlefield of Hastings alongside bishop Odo, exhorting the Normans to victory, and at William''s coronation it was he who called on them to acclaim their duke as king. His reward in England was a mighty fief scattered over 12 counties. He took a leading role in suppressing the wave of English rebellions which erupted in the late summer of 1069. While William marched north against the uprisings in Mercia and Northumbria, Geoffrey gathered troops from the forces occupying London, Winchester and Salisbury and led them to victory against the rebels besieging Montacute Castle in September 1069. In 1075 he again took the field against the Revolt of the Earls, leading alongside Bishop Odo a vast host against Ralph de Gael, whose stronghold at Norwich they besieged and captured.',
'Hamelin de Ballon was an early Norman Baron and the first Baron Abergavenny and Lord of Over Gwent and Abergavenny, titles granted shortly after the Norman Conquest of England and Wales by William the Conqueror. He was from France, from the ancient manor of Ballon, in the ancient province of Maine which was invaded and conquered by Duke William of Normandy in the early 1060s. Hamelin de Ballon was rewarded with land in Cornwall and in south east Wales, in what was to become the Welsh Marches, and charged with its speedy and successful conquest and management. He sited the early motte and bailey version of Abergavenny Castle and organised the early Norman protection of the settlement of what became the town of Abergavenny around 1075, founding the Benedictine Priory in the town and making it a defensible site.',
'Henry I was the fourth son of William I of England. Henry was born in Selby in Yorkshire. His mother, Queen Matilda, named the infant prince Henry, after her uncle, Henry I of France. As the youngest son of the family, he was almost certainly expected to become a bishop and was given more extensive schooling than was usual for a young nobleman of that time. The saintly ascetic Osmund, Bishop of Salisbury, was in part responsible for Henry''s education; Henry was consistently in the bishop''s company during his formative years. "He was an intellectual, an educated man in a sense that his predecessors, excepting Alfred, were not." Henry once remarked that an illiterate king was a crowned ass.',
'Hugh d''Avranches, also known as le Gros (the fat) and Lupus (Wolf) was the first Earl of Chester  and one of the great magnates of early Norman England. He was the son of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches and Emma de Conteville, and inherited from his father a large estate, not just in the Avranchin but scattered throughout western Normandy.  Hugh became an important councillor of William, Duke of Normandy, and contributed sixty ships to the invasion of England. He did not fight at Hastings, instead being one of those trusted to stay behind and govern Normandy.  After William became king, Hugh was given the command of Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, but in 1071 he was promoted to become the first Earl of Chester, with palatine powers in view of Cheshire''s situation on the Welsh border where he was to function as the main bulwark against the Welsh.',
'Odo was the half-brother of William the Conqueror, and was for a time second in power to the king of England. Although ordained a Christian cleric, he is best known as a warrior and statesman. He is one of the very few proven Companions of William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The Bayeux Tapestry, probably commissioned by him, appears to labour the point that he encouraged the troops from the rear.  In 1067, Odo became earl of Kent, and for some years he was a trusted royal minister, serving as de facto regent of England during William’s absence, and at times he led the royal forces against rebellions. During this time Odo acquired estates vaster than any in England except the king.  In 1076, however, Odo was tried  for defrauding the Crown and the Diocese of Canterbury, for which he lost the majority of his assets. His vast wealth was gained mainly by extortion and robbery. His ambitions were boundless and his morals lax. But he was, like many prelates of his age, a patron of learning and the arts and also a great architect.',
'William I was the first Norman King of England, also Duke of Normandy. Before his conquest he was known as William the Bastard because of his illegitimate birth. To press his claim to the English crown, William invaded England in 1066, leading an army of Normans, Bretons, Flemings, and Frenchmen to victory over the forces of King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. "He was of just stature, extraordinary corpulence, fierce countenance; his forehead bare of hair; of such strength of arm that it was often a matter of surprise that no one was able to draw his bow, which he himself could bend when his horse was on full gallop; he was majestic whether sitting or standing, although the protuberance of his belly deformed his royal person: of excellent health so that he was never confined with any dangerous disorder except at the last." William was one of the foremost soldiers of the medieval era, conquering a large kingdom from a smaller base. He also created a feudal state with a strong central government.',
'William II, son of William I of England, is commonly known as William Rufus, because of his red-faced appearance. Although William was an effective soldier, he was a ruthless ruler and, it seems, was little liked by those he governed. William seems to have been a flamboyant character, and his reign was marked by his bellicose temperament. Relations between the three brothers had never been good and, at L''Aigle in 1077, William and Henry having grown bored with casting dice decided to make mischief by emptying a chamber pot onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father was forced to intercede to restore order. William Rufus was "well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting." ',
'Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, was the last surviving pre-Conquest bishop and the only English-born bishop after 1075.  His family lost their lands around the time King Cnut came to the throne. Wulfstan served as treasurer and prior of Worcester. Wulfstan was a confidant of Harold Godwinson, who helped secure the bishopric for him. A social reformer, Wulfstan struggled to bridge the gap between the old and new regimes, and to alleviate the suffering of the poor. William noted that pastoral care of his diocese was Wulfstan''s principal interest. Wulstan was also responsible for stopping the slave trade from Bristol to Ireland. In 1075, Wulfstan and the Worcestershire levy helped put down the rebellion known as ''The Bridal of Norwich'' of Ralph de Gael, Roger de Breteuil, and the Saxon Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria.',
'Yusef ibn Tashfin was a great king of the Almoravid Empire. Yusuf emerged from a line of Berber military leaders. In a series of campaigns through the 1060s, while Abu Bakr ibn Umar held court in Marrakesh, Yusuf directed Almoravid armies against northern Morocco, reducing Zenata strongholds one by one. In 1070, the Moroccan capital of Fez finally fell to the Almoravids. Abu Bakr appears to have handed him leadership, and even went as far as to give Yusuf his wife, Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat. This sort of trust and favour on the part of a seasoned veteran and savvy politician reflected the general esteem in which Yusuf was held, not to mention the power he attained as a military figure in Abu Bakr’s absence. Daunted by Yusuf''s newfound power, Abu Bakr saw any attempts at recapturing his post as politically unfeasible, and returned to the fringes of the Sahara to settle the unrest of the southern frontier. Yusef was an effective general and administrator, evidenced by his ability to organize and maintain the loyalty of the hardened desert warriors and the territory of Abu Bakr, as well as his ability to expand the empire, cross the Atlas Mountains onto the plains of Morocco, reaching the Mediterranean and capturing Fez in 1075, Tangier in 1079, Tlemcen in 1080.',
'Ralph de Gael was the Earl of East Anglia and Lord of Gaël and Montfort. He was the leading figure in the Revolt of the Earls, the last serious revolt against William the Conqueror. He inherited the great Breton barony of Gaël, and held large estates in Norfolk. He fought on the Norman side at the Battle of Hastings and in 1069 he routed a force of Norsemen which had invaded and occupied Norwich. In 1075, the king''s refusal to sanction his marriage caused a revolt in William’s absence by Ralph, his new brother-in-law Roger de Breteuil, and Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northumberland. The revolt was plagued by disaster. Ralph encountered a much superior force under Odo of Bayeux and Geoffrey de Montbray near Cambridge and retreated hurriedly to Norwich, hotly pursued. He attained help from Denmark but was unable to achieve anything effectual. Ralph and his wife retired to their estate in Brittany and he was deprived of all his lands and of his Earldom. For the rest of his life he remained a great baron of Brittany, with no interests in England. In 1076 he plotted against Hoel II, Duke of Brittany, but was defeated with the aid of King William. After this Ralph finally made his peace with the King.',
'Raoul II de Tosny, seigneur de Conches-en-Ouche, was a Norman nobleman of the house of Tosny, son of Roger I of Tosny. He was active in Normandy, England and Wales. He is one of the very few proven Companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Tradition says he gave up the role of standard bearer, his hereditary office, to Walter Giffard, in order to be able to fight closer to William. He had widely spread holdings, his seat being at Flamstead in Hertfordshire. He held Clifford Castle.',
'Robert, Count of Mortain and 1st Earl of Cornwall, was a Norman nobleman and the half-brother of William I of England and full brother to Odo of Bayeux.  He was made Count of Mortain in 1049 and five years later supported William against the French King Henri I''s invasion of Normandy. Robert contributed 120 ships to the fleet for the invasion of England, and in all probability fought at Hastings. Robert was rewarded by the King for his part in the conquest with a large share of the consequent spoil. The greatest concentration of his landed wealth was in Cornwall, granted to him after 1072, when Brian of Brittany decided to return home.  In 1069, together with his cousin Robert of Eu, he led an army against a force of Danes who had laid siege to York. As the Norman forces approached the Danes retreated to the Fens, where they fancied they would be safe. But the two Roberts surprised the Danes whilst they were being entertained by the disaffected natives and "pursued them with great slaughter to their very ships".',
'Robert of Normandy, nicknamed Curthose: meaning short stockings. King William called him brevis-ocrea (short-boot) in derision. In his youth he was reported to be courageous and skilful in military exercises, but also prone to a laziness and weakness of character. He was unsatisfied with the share of power allotted to him and quarrelled with his father and brothers fiercely.  In 1077, Robert instigated his first insurrection against his father as the result of a prank played by his younger brothers William Rufus and Henry, who had dumped a full chamber-pot over his head. Enraged, Robert started a brawl with his brothers only interrupted by the intercession of their father. When King William failed to punish his brothers, the next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize the castle of Rouen. When the siege failed Robert fled eventually to the court of his uncle Robert I, Count of Flanders, before causing such mayhem that his father allied himself with King Philip I of France to stop him. At a battle in January 1079 Robert unhorsed King William and wounded him, stopping his attack only when he recognized his father''s voice. Humiliated, King William cursed his son and raised the siege. At Easter 1080, father and son were reunited by the efforts of Queen Matilda. ',
'Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford, succeeded to the earldom of Hereford and the English estate of William Fitz-Osbern in 1071. He did not keep on good terms with William the Conqueror, and in 1075, disregarding the King''s prohibition, married his sister Emma to Ralph Guader, Earl of Norfolk, at the famous bridal of Norwich. Immediately afterwards the two earls rebelled. Roger, who was to bring his force from the west to join forces with those of the Earl of Norfolk, was held in check at the River Severn by the Worcestershire fyrd which the English Bishop Wulfstan, Walter de Lacy and other Normans brought into the field against him. On the collapse of his confederate''s uprising, Roger was tried before the Great Council, deprived of his lands and Earldom, in 1075 and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment.',
'Roger de Montgomerie was the first Earl of Shrewsbury and one of William the Conqueror''s principal counsellors. He did not fight in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy. Afterwards he was entrusted with land in two places critical for the defence of England, receiving the rape of Arundel at the end of 1067, and in November 1071 he was created Earl of Shrewsbury. Roger was thus one of the half dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror''s reign. William gave Earl Roger nearly all of what is now the county of West Sussex. ',
'Thomas of Bayeux was Archbishop of York. A native of Bayeux, he was educated at Liège and became a royal chaplain to King William I of England. After Thomas'' election, Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, demanded an oath from Thomas to obey him and any future Archbishops of Canterbury; this was part of Lanfranc''s claim that Canterbury was the primary bishopric, and its holder the head of the English Church. Thomas countered that York had never made such an oath. As a result, Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. The King eventually persuaded Thomas to submit, but Thomas and Lanfranc continued to clash over ecclesiastical issues, including the primacy of Canterbury, which dioceses belonged to the province of York, and the question of how York''s obedience to Canterbury would be expressed.'

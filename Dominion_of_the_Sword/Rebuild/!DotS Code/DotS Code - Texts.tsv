				SMT_MISSION_COUNCIL_MARRY_PRINCESS_EXPIRY_PRINCESS_DEATH	Alas, the poor Princess has died; we must call the marriage off.						
				SMT_MISSION_COUNCIL_MARRY_PRINCESS_EXPIRY_TARGET_MARRIED	Love can be a fickle thing, and this lord is twice such, he has married another. The marriage to our Princess is off.						
				SMT_MISSION_COUNCIL_MARRY_PRINCESS_FAILURE_PRINCESS_MARRIED	Love can be a fickle thing, it seems our Princess has married another, the original marriage is off.						
				SMT_MISSION_COUNCIL_MARRY_PRINCESS_EXPIRY_PRINCESS_RETIRED	Our Princess is now too old to marry; her time would be better spent on more solitary and contemplative pursuits. The marriage is off.

				SMT_MISSION_COUNCIL_MARRY_PRINCESS_SUCCESS	Congratulations, you have successfully arranged the marriage we recommended. This union is sure to bear fruit in time.

				SMT_MISSION_ANNEX_SETTLEMENT_TITLE	Annex Settlement						
				SMT_MISSION_ANNEX_SETTLEMENT_PROPOSAL	By rights, this settlement should be under our authority. It is a mockery for it to be held by our rivals.

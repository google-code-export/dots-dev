annus_jubileus			Year of jubilee, Holy Year, established by Boniface VIII in 1300 to be held once a hundred years, but during time the interval shortened until it was merely 25 years or even at the him of the Pope as long as the year was generally correct. During jubilee, a complete remission of sins was granted to pilgrims visiting Rome who visited a certain number of the most important churches there. Pilgrims from all over Christendom descended on Rome, including Dante, St. Birgitta of Sweden and the poet Petrarch. Villani describes the indulgence connected with this jubilee as a full and entire remission of all sins di culpa e di pena (Italian: of guilt and of punishment), and he dwells upon the great contentment and good order of the people, despite the fact that during the greater part of that year there were two hundred thousand pilgrims on an average present in Rome over and above the ordinary population.		social effect	440		Rome_Province

bjarmings_emigrate			Norwegians had been trading across the north of Scandinavia, through the White Sea with Beorma since the 850s. A Norse merchant at the court of Alfred the Great gave an account of his travels with great detail. Several kings such as Eirik Bloodaxe, Harald II, Haakon Magnusson and also Tore Hund all made expeditions or raids into Bjarmaland. The 13th century seems to have seen the decline of the Bjarmings, who became tributaries of the Novgorod Republic. While many Slavs fled the Mongol invasion northward, to Beloozero and Bjarmaland, the displaced Bjarmians sought refuge in Norway, where they were given land in Malangen, by Haakon IV, in 1240. More important for the decline was probably that, with the onset of the Crusades, the trade routes had found a more westerly orientation or shifted considerably to the south. When the Novgorodians founded Velikiy Ustiug, in the beginning of the 13th century, the Bjarmians had a serious competitor for trade. More and more Pomors arrived in the area during the 14th and 15th centuries, which led to the final subjugation and assimilation of the Bjarmians by the Slavs.		social effect	320		Trondheim_Province, Kholmogory_Province			
black_death			The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30% – 60% of Europe's population. Thought to have started in China, it travelled along the Silk Road and had reached the Crimea by 1346. From there, probably carried by Oriental rat fleas residing on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships, it spread throughout the Mediterranean and Europe. The first incursion seems to have come onboard a Genoese vessel from Chersonesos where the crew arrived in port in a state of torpour, most of them dead. It was due to the social situation caused by the reaction to the earlier Great Famine, that allowed the Black Death to reap such a terrible harvest. In Christian Europe, people believed that the plague was punishment from God for the sins of all Christians. In addition to blaming the Jews, there was a widespread belief in the Catholic world that the plague might have been brought on by the corruption of the papacy. This lead to an increase in personal religion or heresy and in turn sowed the seeds for later Protestant Reformations such as the Hussites. Islamic theology held different views about the plague. Muslims agreed with Christians that the disease was the work of God, but they did not necessarily view it as a punishment. Muslims preserved their belief in a compassionate and merciful God, and thus they believed that death from the plague was an offer of martyrdom. They formed three basic tenets for coping with the plague: 1. The plague was a mercy and a martyrdom from God for the faithful Muslim, and a punishment for the infidel. 2. A Muslim should neither enter nor flee a plague-stricken land. 3. There was no contagion of the plague, because diseases came directly from God.  Muslim doctors and scientists often had a difficult time in reconciling these tenets, particularly the third, with growing evidence that a contagion indeed existed. As well, doctors often felt obliged to try to treat people infected with the plague in any way they could, which conflicted with the Islamic theological view that the disease had been sent by God and therefore must simply be endured. Theologians also encountered problems when the plague hit the holy city of Mecca in 1349, likely the result of pilgrimage traffic during the Hajj. The Prophet had promised that no disease would ever come to either Mecca or Medina. Some Muslims explained the Plague's presence in Mecca as the result of unbelievers living there, while others rejoiced in the miracle that it never spread to Medina. Economically, the scarcity of goods caused by the labour shortage resulted in higher prices, while many foreign goods were not available at all, because of Plague-related deaths among foreign merchants. A decline in artistic creativity also followed the Black Death, as many artisans and architects died. The legacy of the continuous shroud of death during this period is demonstrated in art ranging from Persia to Scandinavia, which depicted scenes of death and mourning. 		disaster	532

bulgaria_independence			In the summer of 1185 a miraculous icon of Saint Dimitar of Solun was found in Tarnovo and the Asen brothers claimed that the saint had abandoned Solun in order to help the Bulgarian cause. That had a large psychological impact on the religious population. Between the autumn of 1185 and the spring of 1186 the whole northern Bulgaria with the exception of Varna was liberated. In the summer the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos managed to overcome the mountain passes and invaded Moesia. Asen retreated to the north of the Danube and after the Byzantines went back to Constantinople he returned with more Cuman auxiliaries and soon the war continued to the south in Thrace. A skillful general, Asen stroke swiftly and constantly harassed the larger Byzantine armies. After an unsuccessful siege of Lovech in 1187 the Byzantines were forced to plead for a truce. Three years later they were decisively defeated near Tryavna, Isaac II Angelos barely escaped leaving the Imperial crown and cross. In the next five years the Bulgarian held the initiative and reconquered more towns and castles in northern Thrace and Macedonia especially after the major victory at Arcadiopolis in 1194 and in 1196 the Byzantines were defeated at Serres but soon after that Asen was murdered by his cousin Ivanko incited by the Byzantines. He usurped the throne but could not stay in the capital which was besieged by Peter; fled to Byzantium and was made a governor of Plovdiv. However, only a year later Peter IV became victim of another plot and was succeeded by the youngest brother Kaloyan.		rebel unrest	210

childrens_crusade		Children's Crusade	The Children's Crusade is the name given to a disastrous Crusade by Christian children to expel Muslims from the Holy Land said to have taken place in 1212. The traditional narrative is probably conflated from some factual and mythical notions of the period including visions by a French or German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity, bands of children marching to Italy, and children being sold into slavery. In the first movement, Nicholas, a shepherd from the Rhineland in Germany who possessed an extraordinary power of speech, tried to lead a group across the Alps and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. Nicholas promised that the sea would dry up before them and allow his followers to cross into the Holy Land. Rather than intending to fight the Saracens, he said that the Moslem kingdoms would be defeated when their citizens converted to Christianity. His disciples went off to preach the call for the "Crusade" across the German lands, and they massed in Cologne after a few weeks. Splitting into two groups, the crowds took different roads through Switzerland. Two out of every three people on this ghastly journey died, while many others returned to their homes. About 7,000 arrived in Genoa in late August. They immediately marched to the harbor, expecting the sea to divide before them; when it did not many became bitterly disappointed. A few accused Nicholas of betraying them, while others settled down to wait for God to change his mind, since they believed that it was unthinkable he would not eventually do so. The Genoese authorities were impressed by the little band, and they offered citizenship to those who wished to settle in their city. Most of the would-be Crusaders took up this opportunity. Nicholas refused to admit defeat and traveled to Pisa, his movement continuing to break up along the way. He and a few loyal followers continued to the Papal States, where Pope Innocent III treated them kindly enough. The remaining ones departed for Germany after the Pontiff told them to be good and return home. Nicholas did not survive the second attempt across the Alps; back home his father was arrested and hanged under pressure from angry families whose relatives had perished while following the child. Some of the most dedicated members of this Crusade were later reported to have wandered to Ancona and Brindisi; none reached the Holy Land. The second movement was led by a twelve-year-old French shepherd boy named Stephan of Cloyes, who claimed in June that he bore a letter for the king of France from Jesus. Large gangs of youth around his age were drawn to him, most of whom claimed to possess special gifts of God and thought themselves miracle workers. Attracting a following of over 30,000 adults and children, he went to Saint-Denis, where he was seen to cause miracles. On the orders of Philip II, advised by the University of Paris, the people were implored to return home. Philip himself did not appear impressed, especially since his unexpected visitors were led by a mere child, and refused to take them seriously. Stephan, however, was not dissuaded, and began preaching at a nearby abbey. From Saint-Denis, Stephan traveled around France, spreading his messages as he went, promising to lead charges of Christ to Jerusalem. Although the Church was skeptical, many adults were impressed by his teaching. Still, few of those who initially joined him possessed his activeness; it is estimated that there were less than half the initial 30,000 remaining, a figure that was shrinking rapidly, rather than growing as perhaps anticipated. At the end of June 1212, Stephan led his largely juvenile Crusaders from Vendôme to Marseilles. They survived by begging for food, while the vast majority seem to have been disheartened by the hardship of this journey and returned to their families.		disaster	264					
church_tithes_in_iceland		Church-tithes in Iceland	In this year, Iceland was finally forced to enact tithes for the church in Rome and for the upkeep of the ministries on the island. Most churches were local places or chapels attached to a family farmstead or a village. Of the two Icelandic bishoprics they were large farmsteads like any other and the title of bishop was hereditary, since like many medieval priests- the bishops were married and had children. Therefore the tithes were very unpopular since it was considered to be a form of tax paid to the powerful men of Iceland and gave nothing back to the people.			34

council_of_liubech		Council of Liubech	The Council of Liubech was the first known federal council of the Kievan Rus'. It was held in 1097 between the constantly rivaling regional princes. The council was followed later by another session in Vytechev on August 10, 1100, known as the Council of Vytechev. The council was initiated by Vladimir II Monomakh, and gathered Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich, Vasilko Rostislavich, David Svyatoslavich, Oleg Svyatoslavich, and other Rus' princes. The goal was to stop the brotherly war, to pacify the people, and to present a unified front against the Polovtsy (Cumans). The result was the division of Kievan Rus' among the princes and letting their families inherit them. This broke a Rota system (lestvichesliy right) that was observed in Kievan Rus' for two centuries. The principalities were divided as follows: Sviatopolk II was given Kiev, Turov, Pinsk, and the title of the Grand Prince. Vladimir II Monomakh received Pereyaslavl, Rostov-Suzdal lands, Smolensk, and Beloozero. His son Mstislav received Great Novgorod. Oleg, Davyd, and Yaroslav, all of Sviatoslav, were given Chernigiv, Tmutarakan, Ryazan, and Murom and the remaining izgoi princes: David Igorevich received Volodymyr-Volynskyi. Volodar Rostislavich - Peremyshl. Vasilko Rostislavich - Terebovl. This change effectively established a feudal system in Kievan Rus'. It stopped the struggle for Chernigiv, but was not observed perfectly. After the death of Sviatopolk, the citizens of Kiev revolted and summoned Monomakh to the throne. Nevertheless, it allowed other principalities to consolidate their power and develop as powerful regional centers. Most notably Galicia-Volhynia and Vladimir-Suzdal.		social effect	34					
council_of_london		Council of London	Slave trade in England abolished. Council Ruling 27: "Let no one presume for the future to enter into that nefarious business by which they were accustomed hitherto to sell men like brute animals in England."  Some countries never really gave it up, between 1414 and 1423, at least 10,000 eastern European slaves were sold in Venice alone. About 10% of England’s population entered in the Domesday Book in 1086 were slaves. Norway abolished slavery around 1274, and Sweden in 1343. In a raid on Lisbon in 1189 the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur took 3,000 female and child captives, and his governor of Córdoba took 3,000 Christian slaves in a subsequent attack upon Silves in 1191. In 1382 the Golden Horde under Khan Tokhtamysh sacked Moscow, burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves. Slavery wasn't abolished in Russia until the 18th century. The Council also bans sodomy.			44		London_Province, Norwich_Province, York_Province

fall_of_baghdad			"They swept through the city like hungry falcons attacking a flight of doves, or like raging wolves attacking sheep, with loose reins and shameless faces, murdering and spreading terror...beds and cushions made of gold and encrusted with jewels were cut to pieces with knives and torn to shreds. Those hiding behind the veils of the great Harem were dragged...through the streets and alleys, each of them becoming a plaything...as the population died at the hands of the invaders." Waṣṣāf al-Ḥaḍrat (Persian historian)....In 1257 Möngke Khan (the 4th great Khan) resolved to establish firm imperial authority over Iraq, Syria and Persia. The Khagan sent his brother Hulegu to Iran, demanding that the caliph come to meet Hülegu personally and send troops to assist his army in reducing the Ismaili strongholds. Möngke told Hulegu that if the caliph refused, then he was to destroy Baghdad.Hulegu's conscribed one out of every ten fighting men in the empire for the invasion force, knowing that Baghdad, Ismaili strongholds and Syria were large and powerful in the region. This force is estimated to be upwards of 150,000 strong and was probably the largest force ever fielded by the Mongols.The Siege of Baghdad the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258, was an invasion, siege and sacking of the city. The city was sacked and burned. Even the libraries of Baghdad, including the House of Wisdom, were not safe from the attacks of the Ilkhanate forces, who totally destroyed the libraries and used the invaluable books to make a passage across Tigris River. As a result, Baghdad remained depopulated and in ruins for several centuries, and the event is widely regarded as the end of the Islamic Golden Age.The Grand Library of Baghdad, containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, were destroyed. Survivors said that the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed. The Mongols looted and then destroyed mosques, palaces, libraries, and hospitals. Grand buildings that had been the work of generations were burned to the ground. The caliph was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, as they believed that the earth was offended if touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.Citizens attempting to flee, were intercepted by Hulegu's soldiers and killed with abandon. The invasion left Baghdad in a state of total destruction. Estimates of the number of inhabitants massacred during the invasion range from 100,000 to 1,000,000. a Due to the stench of decay from the ruined city Hulagu had his camp moved upwind. Baghdad was a depopulated, ruined shell of a city for several centuries and only gradually recovered some of its former glory.              		spawn	354

first_lateran_council			The Council of 1123 is reckoned in the series of Ecumenical councils by the Catholic Church. It was convoked by Pope Callixtus II in December, 1122, immediately after the Concordat of Worms. The council convoked by Callistus II was significant in size: three hundred bishops and more than six hundred abbots assembled at Rome in March, 1123; Callistus presided in person. For the most part, Pope Callistus II summoned the council to ratify the various meetings and concords which had been occurring in and around Rome for several years. The most pressing issue was that of the Investiture controversy which had consumed nearly a century of contention and open warfare. At the heart of the question was the ancient right of the Holy Roman Emperor to name the pope as well as bishops and priests. These would be invested with some secular symbol such as a sword or scepter and the spiritual authority represented by a ring, miter and crosier. To an illiterate population, it appeared the bishop or abbot was now the king’s inferior and owed his position to the king. This issue came to the fore in the first part of the eleventh century when Rome and the pope sought autonomy from the Holy Roman Emperor. It had been a central issue in the reign of Pope Gregory VII and his battles with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. The issue was never settled. Years of teaching by Roman trained priests and bishops in Germany had led to an educated generation which once and for all, rejected the idea of divine right of kings. It would never hold sway again in Europe, at least with as much conviction as it had prior to Lateran I. At the time, the Concordat of Worms was proclaimed as a great victory for Henry V inside the Holy Roman Empire. It did serve to constrain much of the most recent warfare in and outside the empire. In the end, Henry V died the monarch of a much diminished kingdom. Although it may have been the end of the Investiture controversy it was only the beginning for the Guelph and Ghibelline wars.			86

In 800, Charlemagne, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, enlarged Probus' hospital and added a library to it. About 200 years later, in 1005, Caliph Al Hakim destroyed the hospital and three thousand other buildings in Jerusalem. In 1023, Italian merchants from Amalfi and Salerno were given permission by the Caliph Ali az-Zahir of Egypt to rebuild the hospital in Jerusalem, which was built on the site of the monastery of Saint John the Baptist, and took in Christian pilgrims travelling to visit the Christian holy sites. It was served by Benedictine monks. The monastic hospitaller order was founded by the Blessed Gerard before the end of the Crusade in 1099, whose role as founder was confirmed by a Papal bull of Pope Paschal II in 1113. Gerard acquired territory and revenues for his order throughout the Kingdom of Jerusalem and beyond. His successor, Raymond du Puy de Provence, established the first significant Hospitaller infirmary near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. Initially the group cared for pilgrims in Jerusalem, but the order soon extended to providing pilgrims with an armed escort, which soon grew into a substantial force. The concept became quickly renowned, it directly inspired and nurtured the Templar Order and most notably it was the parent body of the Order of Lazarus and the Teutonic Order. Throughout the Middle Ages it was the largest, most populous and militarily successful Order.			66

great_comet_of_1106		Great Comet of 1106	A Great Comet that appeared on February 2, 1106, and was observed across the world from the beginning of February through to mid-March. It was recorded by astronomers in Wales, England, Japan, Korea, China and Europe. It was observed to split in two. A brief note in the Welsh manuscript known as the Brut y Tywysogion reads (in translation): [-1106]. In that year there was seen a star wonderful to behold, throwing out behind it a beam of light of the thickness of a pillar in size and of exceeding brightness, foreboding what would come to pass in the future: for Henry, emperor of Rome, after mighty victories and a most pious life in Christ, went to his rest. And his son, after winning the seat of the empire of Rome, was made emperor. The 1106 annal of the Peterborough Chronicle describes the comet. The Dorothy Whitlock translation reads: In the first week of Lent, on the Friday, 16 February, in the evening, there appeared an unusual star, and for a long time after that it was seen shining a while every evening. This star appeared in the south-west; it seemed small and dark. The ray that shone from it, however, was very bright, and seemed to be like an immense beam shining north-east; and one evening it appeared as if this beam were forking into many rays toward the star from an opposite direction.		historic	52					
great_famine		The Great Famine	The Great Famine of 1315–1317 (occasionally dated 1315–1322) was the first of a series of large scale crises that struck North Europe early in the fourteenth century, causing millions of deaths over an extended number of years and marking a clear end to an earlier period of growth and prosperity during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Starting with bad weather in spring 1315, universal crop failures lasted through 1316 until summer 1317; Europe did not fully recover until 1322. It was a period marked by extreme levels of crime, disease, mass death and even cannibalism and infanticide. It had consequences for Church, State, European society and future calamities to follow in the fourteenth century. It was the worst famine in European history, reducing the population by more than 10%. Where government authorities were concerned, most monarchs instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned black market speculators, set price controls on grain and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable and at worst they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad: from France because of the prohibition, and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by pirates or looters to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their treasury and exacerbating inflation. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs such as Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377) and Philip VI of France (r. 1328–1350), raised the fines and rents of their tenants out of a fear that their comparatively high standard of living would decline. The European economy entered a vicious circle in which hunger and chronic, low-level debilitating disease reduced the productivity of labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. Standards of living fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole experienced more health problems which reduced the population's immune systems to exacerbate the effects of the later Black Death.		disaster	470					
gunpowder_in_europe		Gunpowder Explodes into Europe	The Norwegian 'Konungs Skuggsjá' of 1250 AD mentions in its military chapter, the use of two key ingredients: "coal and sulphur" as the best weapons for ship-to-ship combat. Dated around 1257 AD, among the earliest extant written references to gunpowder in Europe, are Roger Bacon's texts Epistola, "De Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae et de Nullitate Magiae," dated variously between 1248 and 1257, he states: We can, with saltpeter and other substances, compose artificially a fire that can be launched over long distances... By only using a very small quantity of this material much light can be created accompanied by a horrible fracas. It is possible with it to destroy a town or an army ... In order to produce this artificial lightning and thunder it is necessary to take saltpeter, sulfur, and Luru Vopo Vir Can Utriet.		units unlock	340

hugh_of_stvictor		Hugh of St. Victor joins the Victorines in Paris.	The school of St Victor was the medieval monastic school at the Augustinian abbey of St Victor. The name also refers to the Victorines, the group of philosophers and mystics based at this school as part of the University of Paris. It was founded in the twelfth century by Peter Abelard's tutor and subsequent opponent, the realist school master William of Champeaux, and a prominent early member of their community was Hugh of St Victor. Other prominent members were Richard of St Victor, Walter of St Victor and Godfrey of St Victor, as well as Thomas Gallus. Under the rigorous supervision of Hugh, St Victor offered a coherent and structured approach to learning through the cultivation of personal virtue rather than the requisition of knowledge for its own sake. This is exemplified in the schema for the liberal arts laid out in Hugh's Didascalicon, in which he exhorts the reader to Omnia Disce, or to know all. By 1160, the abbey had become a place of retreat from the schools, echoing the original act of weary retirement enacted by William of Champeaux at its founding. By the time of Godfrey, St Victor was primarily concerned with the instruction of its own canons, rather than the emphasis on the extern school operated earlier in the twelfth century. The end of the Victorines as a unique force came by 1173, when the reactionary Walter was appointed as prior. Walter launched a furious attack upon the intellectual culture of the school and its members with his Contra quatuor labyrinthos Francae (Against the Four Labyrinths of France), a denunciation of secular theological teaching. After this violent repudiation of Victorine pedagogical tradition the abbey was, in effect, a self-contained Augustinian priory like any other.		social effect	70

investiture_controversy		La Gran Contessa	In 1081, Contessa Matilda donated all her estates to the church, which granted them back to her as a fief for life, and sent the major part of her personal treasure to the Pope. Her now dead husband was Godefroi of Lotharingia, son of Goderfroi II "le Barbu" Comte de Verdun, ex-Duke of Upper Lotharingia, provided troops for Heinrich IV King of Germany in the latter's struggle against the Saxons in 1074, to the displeasure of Pope Gregory VII. Duke Godefroi's name appears in the list of the nobles who purportedly deposed the Pope at Worms 24 Jan 1076.  He also volunteered to lead the army to Rome to expel the Pope.  He died from stab wounds after being surprised by an unknown assassin supposedly hired by Robert Count of Flanders at Vlaardingen, near Antwerp 1076. In this manner she sided now with the Papal tide against Heinrich and became one of his staunchest opponents. King Heinrich IV confiscated Ctss Matilda's properties in Lotharingia (inherited from her mother) and occupied Metz in 1085, awarding the lordships of Stenay and Mouzay to Thierry Bishop of Verdun as a reward for his support.			4

last_message_from_greenland		Last Message From Greenland	Papal records in 1345 receive word from the Bishop of Greenland that his people are too poor to pay their church taxes: the Little Ice Age had hit hard. Around 1350 the Western Settlements were abandoned completely and the population retreated into huddled snowsept villages in the east, forced to eat their own dogs. In 1354 King Magnus of Norway authorizes Powell Knutsson to sail to Greenland to "protect" the Christians there due to in-fighting between Norse pagans and Christians. The grim times of pestilence and hunger no doubt encouraged many to return to the Old Ways, praying for good harvests. Pagans were persecuted, hunted and enslaved, but responded with violence. In 1364 Jacobus Cnoyen, a Dutch merchant at the Norwegian capital reports 2 Greenlandic priests request help from the King. In 1374 the King's Ombudsman sails for Greenland to ascertain why there have been no reports from the colony. In 1378 the last Bishop of Greenland dies, the following year Gottskalks Annals, an Icelandic chronicle, reports that Skraelings (Greenland natives) attacked the Norse Greenlanders at the Eastern Settlement, killing 18 and enslaving 2 boys and a chieftain's wife. In 1400 the last Norwegian Royal governor dies. In 1410 reports reach Iceland of pagan witches being burnt at the stake. Then there was silence. 38 years later, Pope Nicholas V documents that a ship with a mere dozen or so terrified Christians from Greenland has appeared in Europe, asking for asylum and pleading for a priest. If they did tell what had happened in Greenland it was never recorded. Their's would be the last ship ever to leave the colony.			736

magdeburg_rights		Magdeburger Recht	Magdeburg Rights (German: Magdeburger Recht) or Magdeburg Law were a set of German town laws regulating the degree of internal autonomy within cities and villages granted by a local ruler. Modelled and named after the laws of the German city of Magdeburg and developed during many centuries of the Holy Roman Empire, it was possibly the most important set of Germanic mediæval city laws. Adopted by numerous monarchs in Central and Eastern Europe, the law was a milestone in urbanization of the region and prompted the development of thousands of villages and cities. Apart from Magdeburg itself, notable towns based on Magdeburg Law (or its local variants) were Biecz, Frysztak, Sandomierz, Kraków, Kurów, Minsk, Polotsk, Poznań, Ropczyce, Łódź, Wrocław, Szczecin, Złotoryja, Vilnius, Trakai, Kaunas, Hrodna, Kiev, Lviv, Czernowitz (currently Chernivtsi in Ukraine), Brody, Lutsk, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Sanok, Sniatyn, and Nizhyn, as well as Bardejov, Humenné and Krupina in present-day Slovakia. Among the most advanced systems of old Germanic law of the time, in the 13th and 14th centuries, Magdeburg rights were granted to more than a hundred cities, in the north and east towards Russia, including Schleswig, Bohemia, Poland, Belarus, especially in Pomerania, Prussia, Lithuania (following the Christianization of Lithuania), Ukraine, and probably Moldavia. In these lands they were mostly known as German or Teutonic law. Since the local tribunal of Magdeburg thus also became the superior court for these towns, Magdeburg, together with Lübeck, practically defined the law of northern Germany, Poland and Lithuania for centuries, being the heart of the most important "family" of city laws.		social effect	340

massacre_of_the_latins		The Massacre of the Latins 	The Massacre of the Latins occurred in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, in 1182. It was a large-scale massacre of the "Latin" (Roman Catholic) merchants and their families, who at that time dominated the city's maritime trade and financial sector. Although precise numbers are unavailable, the bulk of the Latin community, estimated at over 60,000 at the time,was wiped out or forced to flee. The Genoese and Pisan communities especially were decimated, and some 4,000 survivors were sold as slaves to the Turks. Since the late 11th century, Western merchants, primarily from the Italian city-states of Venice, Genoa and Pisa, had started appearing in the East. The first had been the Venetians, who had secured large-scale trading concessions from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Subsequent extensions of these privileges and Byzantium's own naval impotence at the time resulted in a virtual maritime monopoly and stranglehold over the Empire by the Venetians. Alexios' grandson, Manuel I Komnenos, wishing to reduce their influence, began to reduce the privileges of Venice while concluding agreements with her rivals: Pisa, Genoa and Amalfi. Gradually, all four Italian cities were also allowed to establish their own quarters in the northern part of Constantinople itself, towards the Golden Horn. The predominance of the Italian merchants caused economic and social upheaval in Byzantium: it accelerated the decline of the independent native merchants in favour of big exporters, who became tied with the landed aristocracy, who in turn increasingly amassed large estates. Together with the perceived arrogance of the Italians, it fueled popular resentment amongst the middle and lower classes both in the countryside and in the cities. The religious differences between the two sides, who viewed each other as schismatics, further exacerbated the problem. The Italians proved uncontrollable by imperial authority: in 1162, for instance, the Pisans together with a few Venetians raided the Genoese quarter in Constantinople, causing much damage. Emperor Manuel subsequently expelled most of the Genoese and Pisans from the city, thus giving the Venetians a free hand for several years. In early 1171, however, when the Venetians attacked and largely destroyed the Genoese quarter in Constantinople, the Emperor retaliated by ordering the mass arrest of all Venetians throughout the Empire and the confiscation of their property. A subsequent Venetian expedition in the Aegean failed: a direct assault was impossible due to the strength of the Byzantine forces, and the Venetians agreed to negotiations, which the Emperor stalled intentionally. As talks dragged on through the winter, the Venetian fleet waited at Chios, until an outbreak of the plague forced them to withdraw. The Venetians and the Empire remained at war, with the Venetians prudently avoiding direct confrontation but sponsoring Serb uprisings, besieging Ancona, Byzantium's last stronghold in Italy, and signing a treaty with the Norman Kingdom of Sicily. Relations were only gradually normalized: there is evidence of a treaty in 1179 although a full restoration of relations would only be reached in the mid-1180s. Meanwhile, the Genoese and Pisans profited from the dispute with Venice, but this did not last long, with the rise of the Latin princess Maria of Antioch as regent to her infant son the favouritism towards Italians naturally rose, creating a backlash: being overthrown in April 1182 by Andronikos I Komnenos, who entered the city in a wave of popular support. Almost immediately, the celebrations spilled over into violence towards the hated Latins. The ensuing massacre was indiscriminate: neither women nor children were spared, and the Latin priests and monks received special attention. Cardinal John, the Pope's representative, was beheaded and his head was dragged through the streets tied to the tail of a dog. These events caused great friction between the east and west and the tear in the trade system, particularly breaking the Silk and Spice routes paved the way for the Crusader sacking of Constantinople and subsequent conquest in 1204.		rebel unrest	204

As part of this persecution, the destruction of the three towns of Speyer, Worms and Mainz were noted as the "Hurban Shum" (Destruction of Shum). These were new persecutions of the Jews in which peasant crusaders from France and Germany attacked Jewish communities. A number of authors refer to the events as "pogroms". According to David Nirenberg, the events of 1096 in the Rhineland occupy a significant place in modern Jewish historiography and are often presented as the first instance of an antisemitism that would henceforth never be forgotten and whose climax was the Holocaust.		social effect	32					
rise_of_danish_cross		Rise of the Dannebrog	Legend states the origin of the flag as the Battle of Lyndanisse, also known as the Battle of Valdemar (Danish: "Volmerslaget"), near Lyndanisse (Tallinn) in Estonia, on June 15, 1219. Fought by Danish crusaders against pagan Lithuanians. The battle was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. But then, right when the Danes were about to give up, the flag fell from heaven. Grasping the flag before it could ever touch the ground, the king took it in his hand, and proudly waved it in front of his discouraged troops, giving them hope, and leading them to victory. This legend echoes several similar tales told in connection with nationalism during the Middle Ages usually grounded in crusades, such as the Iberians against the Moors, the English in Jerusalem, the Swedes in Finland, and so on. Many ideas to the origin of the cross colours have been given, one is the crusader cross that was originally designated to the English forces in the Levant, who having Danes in their ranks may have taken it as their own symbol. Another origin might simply be the warbanner of the Holy Roman Empire. The earliest source that indisputably links the red flag with a white cross to a Danish King, and to the realm itself, is found in a Dutch armorial, the "Gelre Armorial" (Dutch: Wapenboek Gelre), written between 1340 and 1370		ancillary unlocked	278

rise_of_gui_delusignan		Gui deLusignan 	Guy of Lusignan (c. 1150 – 18 July 1194) was a Poitevin knight, son of Hugh VIII of the prominent Lusignan dynasty. He was king of the crusader state of Jerusalem from 1186 to 1192 by right of marriage to Sibylla of Jerusalem, and of Cyprus from 1192 to 1194. Having arrived in the Holy Land in the 1170s, Guy rose to prominence within the royal courts of Baldwin IV before marrying Sybilla in 1180 to prevent a political incident within the kingdom. As Baldwin's health deteriorated, Guy was appointed regent of Jerusalem; upon Sybilla's succession to the throne, Guy was crowned king-consort in 1186. Guy's reign was marked by increased hostilities with the Ayyubids ruled by Saladin, culminating in the disastrous Battle of Hattin in July 1187—during which Guy was captured—and the fall of Jerusalem itself three months later. Following a year of imprisonment in Damascus, Guy was released by Saladin. After being denied entry to Tyre, one of the last crusader strongholds, by Conrad of Montferrat, Guy besieged Acre in 1189. The siege would develop into a rally point for the Third Crusade, led by Philip Augustus of France and Sibylla's cousin Richard the Lionheart. Guy entered a bitter row with Conrad over the kingship of Jerusalem; despite Richard's support for Guy, Conrad was elected king by the nobility of the kingdom. Conrad was assassinated by the Hashshashin days after the election; Richard's and Guy's involvement in the incident is suspected, but unproven. Nevertheless, Guy was compensated for the dispossession of his crown by being given lordship of Cyprus in 1192, which Richard had annexed from the Byzantine Empire en route to the Levant. Guy ruled the Kingdom of Cyprus until his death in 1194, when he was succeeded by his brother Amalric.		character spawn	172					
rise_of_jehan_le_meingre		Jehan le Meingre	Jean II Le Maingre (in Old French, Jehan le Meingre), called Boucicaut (1366-1421) was Marshal of France and a knight renowned for his military skill. He was the son of marshal Jean I Le Maingre, also called Boucicaut. He became a page at the court of Charles VI of France, and at the age of 12 he accompanied Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, in a campaign against Normandy. At age 16 he was knighted by Louis on the eve of the Battle of Roosebeke (November 27, 1382). In 1383 he began the first of his journeys that would take up more than twenty years of his life. In 1384 he undertook his first journey to Prussia, in order to assist the Teutonic Order in their war against the pagan Lithuanians, who would convert to Roman Catholicism in 1386. After some campaigns against the Moors in Spain, and against Toulouse in France he again accompanied the duke of Bourbon, this time to Spain, which had become a secondary battlefield of the Hundred Years' War. From there he travelled for two years through the Balkans, the Near East, and the Holy Land, in the company of his friend Renaud of Roye and later with Philip of Artois, Count of Eu. There, he and his companions composed the Livre des Cent Ballades, a poetical defense of the chaste knight the central figure of chivalry, which Johan Huizinga found a startling contrast with the facts of his military career. In 1390, while the Peace of Leulingen had temporarily interrupted the war with England, Boucicaut took part in the tournament of Saint-Inglevert, where he defeated the most famous English soldiers in single combat. The next year he travelled to Prussia for a third time. Because of his great service in the war against the heathens in Livonia and Prussia, he was named Marshal of France on December 25, 1391, by Charles VI at the cathedral of St. Martin in Tours. In 1396 he was took part in the joint French-Hungarian crusade against the Ottoman Empire, which suffered a heavy defeat on September 28 at the Battle of Nicopolis. He was taken hostage by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I, but, unlike many of his companions, escaped execution and was eventually ransomed. In 1399, he founded the Emprise de l'Escu vert à la Dame Blanche, a chivalric order inspired by the ideal of courtly love: "one might have supposed him cured of all chivalrous delusions after the catastrophe of Nicopolis", remarked Huizinga. In the same year, he was sent with six ships carrying 1,200 men to assist Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaeologus against the Ottomans. In 1401, due to his military accomplishments and his knowledge of the east, he was appointed French governor of Genoa, which had fallen to Charles VI in 1396. He successfully repelled an attack from King Janus of Cyprus, who tried to take back the city of Famagusta on Cyprus, which had been captured by Genoa. After some struggles in the Mediterranean the Genoese freed themselves from French rule by 1409. Boucicaut returned to France and became involved in the rivalry between Burgundy and Orléans. In the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 he commanded the French vanguard, but was captured by the English and died six years later in Yorkshire. He was buried in the cathedral of Tours, in his family's chapel, with the epitaph "Grand Constable of the Emperor and of the Empire of Constantinople."		character spawn	604

rise_of_st_george		Rise of the warbanner of St.George	In England the earliest dedication to George, who was mentioned among the martyrs by Bede, is a church at Fordington, Dorset, that is mentioned in the will of Alfred the Great; "Saint George and his feast day began to gain more widespread fame among all Europeans, however, from the time of the Crusades." The tradition may have had some origins in an older pagan cult connected with the Old English god Thunor, remembered in the name of the weekday Thursday. Like St George, Thunor slew the World-Serpent which is a theme echoed in the eastern cults of Mithras and other warrior sun-gods. The St. George's flag, a red cross on a white field, was adopted by England and the City of London in 1190 for their ships entering the Mediterranean to benefit from the protection of the Genoese fleet during the Crusades and the English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the Doge of Genoa for this privilege.[citation needed] An apparition of George heartened the Franks at the siege of Antioch, 1098, and made a similar appearance the following year at Jerusalem. Chivalric military Order of St. George were established in Aragon (1201), Genoa, Hungary, and by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, and in England the Synod of Oxford, 1222 declared St. George's Day a feast day in the kingdom of England. Edward III put his Order of the Garter under the banner of St. George, probably in 1348. The chronicler Froissart observed the English invoking St. George as a battle cry on several occasions during the Hundred Years' War. In his rise as a national saint George was aided by the very fact that the saint had no legendary connection with England, and no specifically localized shrine, as of Thomas Becket at Canterbury:		ancillary unlocked	220					
rise_of_swedish_cross		Rise of the Korsbaneren        	According to legend the 12th century Swedish king Eric the Holy saw a golden cross in the sky as he landed in Finland during the First Swedish Crusade against the pagans in 1157. Seeing this as a sign from God he adopted the golden cross against a blue background as his banner. It has also been suggested that the Swedish flag might have been a resistance flag against the Danish flag, which is red with a white cross, and which has been known since 1219. According to this theory, the Swedish flag was created during the reign of King Charles Knutsson, who also introduced the Coat of arms of Sweden in 1442. The national coat of arms is a combination of King Albert of Mecklenburg's coat of arms of 1364 and King Magnus Birgersson's coat of arms of 1275, and is blue divided quarterly by a golden cross pattée. Several other cases of crusader crosses originate during this period all across Europe, including England and Scotland.			154

rise_of_william_marshall		William Marshall	An Anglo-Norman soldier and statesman. He was described as the "greatest knight that ever lived" by Stephen Langton. As a younger son of a minor nobleman, William had no lands or fortune to inherit, and had to make his own way in life. Around the age of twelve, when his father's career was faltering, he was sent to Normandy to be brought up in the household of William de Tancarville, a great magnate and cousin of young William's mother. Here he began his training as a knight. He was knighted in 1166 on campaign in Upper Normandy, then being invaded from Flanders. His first experience of warfare was not a great success. He failed to take advantage of the knights he had managed to overcome in the street skirmish at Neufchâtel-en-Bray. In 1167 he was taken by William de Tancarville to his first tournament where he found his true métier. Quitting the Tancarville household he then served in the household of his mother's brother, Patrick, Earl of Salisbury. In 1168 his uncle was killed in an ambush by Guy de Lusignan. William was injured and captured in the same skirmish, but was ransomed by Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was apparently impressed by tales of his bravery. Thereafter he found he could make a good living out of winning tournaments. At that time tournaments were dangerous, often deadly, staged battles, not the jousting contests that would come later, and money and valuable prizes could be won by capturing and ransoming opponents, their horses and armour. His record is legendary: on his deathbed he recalled besting 500 knights during his tourneying career. He served four kings — Henry II, Richard the Lionheart, John and Henry III — and rose from obscurity to become a regent of England for the last of the four, and so, one of the most powerful men in Europe. Before him, the hereditary title of "Marshal" designated head of household security for the king of England; by the time he died, people throughout Europe (not just England) referred to him simply as "the Marshal".		character spawn	172

seljuq_jihad_against_georgia		Jihad against Georgia	The resurgence of Georgians’ military energies brought about a coordinated Muslim response. Sultan Mahmud II b. Muhammad (r. 1118-1131) sent an expedition into Georgia in which the Artuqid Ilghazi of Mardin, the Mazyadid Dubays II b. Sadaqa of Al Hillah and the sultan’s brother Tughrul, lord of Arran and Nakhichevan, with his atabeg Kun-toghdi all took part. This combined army under the overall command of Ilghazi entered the valley of Trialeti in eastern Georgia and encamped in the vicinities of Didgori and Manglisi in mid-August 1121. The number of combatants as well as the course of the battle is differently related in the contemporaneous historical records. The strength of the Seljuq army is variously put, by the medieval Islamic, Georgian, Armenian and European sources from 200,000 to 605,000. King David’s army has traditionally been estimated at 40,000 Georgians, 15,000 Kipchaks, 500 Alans and 100 "Frankish" Crusaders. According to the Arab chronicler Ibn al-Asir, David sent 200 soldiers to the Seljuq camp prior to the battle. They pretended to be renegades and suddenly attacked as they reached the enemy’s lines. Meanwhile, the main Georgian forces, which were already divided in several groups under David and his son, Demetre, struck against the Seljuq flanks. In a pitched three-hour action, the Seljuq troops were completely overrun and forced into flight, leaving a large amount of booty and prisoners to the victors.  Following the victory, David moved relentlessly against the remaining pockets of Muslim resistance and next year, in 1122, he stormed Tbilisi, so that the city might become, according to a Georgian chronicler, "for ever an arsenal and capital for his sons." The medieval sources emphasize David’s acts of revenge against the Muslims of Tbilisi. However, the Arab historian al-'Ayni (1360-1451), who utilizes sources, some of which have not survived, admits that the city was pillaged but says that the Georgian king eventually showed patience and "respected the feelings of the Muslims more than Muslim rulers had done."			82

siege_of_maarra		Siege of Ma'arra	The most infamous event from the city's history dates from late 1098, during the First Crusade. After the Crusaders, led by Raymond de Saint Gilles and Bohemond of Taranto, successfully besieged Antioch they found themselves with insufficient supplies of food. Their raids on the surrounding countryside during the winter months did not help the situation. By December 12 when they reached Ma`arra, many of them were suffering from starvation and malnutrition. They managed to breach the city's walls and massacred about 20,000 inhabitants, as they often did when they captured a city. However, this time, as they could not find enough food, they resorted to cannibalism. One of the crusader commanders wrote to Pope Urban II: "A terrible famine racked the army in Ma`arra, and placed it in the cruel necessity of feeding itself upon the bodies of the Saracens. Radulph of Caen, another chronicler, wrote: "In Ma`arra our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking-pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled." These events were also chronicled by Fulcher of Chartres, who wrote: "I shudder to tell that many of our people, harassed by the madness of excessive hunger, cut pieces from the buttocks of the Saracens already dead there, which they cooked, but when it was not yet roasted enough by the fire, they devoured it with savage mouth."			36

synod_of_cashel		Synod of Cashel 	The Synod of Cashel of 1172, also known as the Second Synod of Cashel, was assembled at Cashel at the request of Henry II of England shortly after his arrival in Ireland in October 1171. The Synod sought to regulate some affairs of the Church in Ireland and to condemn some abuses, bringing the Church more into alignment with the Roman Rite. As such it can be seen as a continuation and part of the Irish church reform of the Twelfth Century, and the first synod of Cashel, the Synod of Rathbreasail and the Synod of Kells, slowly embracing the Gregorian Reforms. More importantly Henry II also declared that all English slaves in bondage throughout Ireland were to be freed, overall it was a sign of great change in Ireland, and more specifically signified religious acceptance of English rule. The Irish records of the time, relate that it was the English who sold their own sons to the Irish for centuries because they were so poor, and as good Christians it was their duty to help the English from such sins. The other acts instituted by Henry II were the abolition of incest and the enforcement of baptism and proper burial of the dead.			184

the_great_rising 		The Great Rising 	The Peasants' Revolt, Wat Tyler's Rebellion, or the Great Rising of 1381 was one of a number of popular revolts in late medieval Europe and is a major event in the history of England. Tyler's Rebellion was not only the most extreme and widespread insurrection in English history but also the best-documented popular rebellion to have occurred during medieval times. The names of some of its leaders, John Ball, Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, are still familiar in popular culture, although little is known of them. The revolt later came to be seen as a mark of the beginning of the end of serfdom in medieval England, although the revolt itself was a failure. It increased awareness in the upper classes of the need for the reform of feudalism in England and the appalling misery felt by the lower classes as a result of their enforced near-slavery.		character spawn	602

victual_brothers 		Victual Brothers rise	Klaus Störtebeker a German privateer appears in the North Sea as the leader of the Victual Brothers also known as Vitalians, the Vitalian Brotherhood or Likedeelers ('equal sharers'). These pirates had bases all across Scandinavia and Northern Germany, despite being pirates they were orginally employed in conspiracy by the Hanseatic League to harrass Denmark and its attempts to form the Kalmar Union. The guild had a main base on Gotland for which reason King Albrecht of Sweden pledged the island to the Teutonic Order to drive them out. Queen Margaret even turned to Richard II of England to charter ships to combat the threat. During their 80 year reign of terror they sacked and burnt Bergen, captured Malmö and sacked Åbo with bases in most estuaries from Frisia to Finland. Their warcry was "God's friends and the whole world's enemies". 		character spawn	624					
war_of_the_eight_saints 		War of the Eight Saints 	The War of the Eight Saints (1375–1378) was a war between Pope Gregory XI and a coalition of Italian city-states led by Florence, which contributed to the end of the Avignon Papacy. It was based on Florentine opposition to the expansion of the Papal States in central Italy (which the Avignon Popes had set as a condition for their return) and friction toward the Parte Guelfa in Florence. When the Papacy ended their war with Milan in 1375, Tuscany feared the Papacy would force expansion upon them. Florence formed an alliance with Milan in July 1375, immediately prior to the outbreak of the war, and the prosecution of the war was entirely delegated to an eight-member committee appointed by the Signoria of Florence: the otto della guerra. Florence incited a revolt in the Papal States in 1375. Florentine agents were sent to more than forty cities in the papal states—including Bologna, Perugia, Orvieto, and Viterbo—to foment rebellion, many of which had only been re-submitted to papal authority by the efforts of Cardinal Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz. Humanist Chancellor of Florence Coluccio Salutati disseminated public letters urging the cities to rebel against the "tyrannical" and "corrupt" papal rule, instead urging a return to all'antica Republicanism. Robert of Geneva, future Avignon Pope Clement VII, the commander of papal forces until 1377. Pope Gregory XI excommunicated all members of the government of Florence and placed the city under interdict on March 31, 1376, banning religious services in Florence and legalizing the arrest and enslavement of Florentines and the confiscation of their property throughout Europe. The war ended with a peace treaty concluded at Tivoli in July 1378, negotiated with Pope Urban VI following the death of Gregory XI and with the beginning of the Western Schism. Under the treaty, Florence was to pay the Pope 200,000 florins to repeal the order of Excommunication.		rebel unrest	590

omne_datum_optimum 		Omne Datum Optimum 	Omne Datum Optimum (Latin for "Every perfect gift", a quotation from the Epistle of James) was a Papal Bull issued by Pope Innocent II in 1139 that initially endorsed the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon (Knights Templar), in which the Templar Rule was officially approved, and papal protection given. Additionally, Omne Datum Optimum promised all spoils from Muslim conquest to the Order, and made the Order exempt from tithes and taxes: "As for the things that you will receive from the spoils, you can confidently put them to your own use, and we prohibit that you be coerced against your will to give anyone a portion of these." Although Omne Datum Optimum was an unusual bull in and of itself, it was followed by Pope Celestine II's Milites Templi in 1144 and Pope Eugene III's Militia Dei in 1145, which together gave the Templars an extraordinary range of rights and privileges. Among other things, the Order was permitted to build its own churches, bury their dead on those church grounds and collect taxes on Templar properties once a year. The unique cemeteries constructed by the Templars proved to be extremely controversial.			118

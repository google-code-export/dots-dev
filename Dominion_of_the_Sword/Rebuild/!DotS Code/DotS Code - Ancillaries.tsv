Sancho_Ramirez_Bio	-	Sancho Ramírez	Sancho Ramírez was King of Aragon from 1063 (though not formally until 1076) and King of Navarre (from 1076, as Sancho V). Between 1067 and 1068, the War of the Three Sanchos involved him in a conflict with his first cousins, both also named Sancho, in which Sancho of Castile defeated Sancho IV of Navarre and Sancho Ramírez, retaking a number of territories from the two. Sancho Ramírez followed his father's practice of not using the royal title early in his reign, though his state had become fully independent. This changed in 1076, when Sancho IV of Navarre was murdered, prompting a succession crisis in this neighbouring kingdom that represented Aragon's nominal overlord. The crisis was resolved by partition, and Sancho Ramírez was elected King of Navarre. From this time Sancho referred to himself as king not only of Navarre but also of Aragon.

Ermengol_Bio	-	Ermengol IV	Ermengol IV, called el de Gerb or Gerp, was the Count of Urgell from 1066. He was the son of Ermengol III and Clemencia, daughter of Bernard II of Bigorre. Ermengol inherited Urgell when he was only ten years old and ruled under the tutelage of the countess dowager, Sancha, third wife of his father, until he was twelve. During this brief minority, the nobility took the opportunity to plunder and occupy the comital demesne. It was not until 1075 that Ermengol was in control of his county and his nobles. Ermengol was an active count. During his reign Urgell profited economically by receiving exiles from Lleida and Fraga. Ermengol was a firm supporter of the contemporary Gregorian reform of the Church, which he introduced to Urgel. In 1077 Ermengol married Lucy, daughter of Bernard I of La Marche. With her he had his son and heir, Ermengol V. 	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

Philaretos_Brachamios_Bio	-	Philaretos Brachamios	Philaretos Brachamios was a distinguished Byzantine general and warlord of Armenian heritage, and for a time was a usurper against Emperor Michael VII. Noted for his cruelty and greed, Philaretos held a high command in the army of Romanus IV Diogenes. In 1069 he was given the command of the main Byzantine army that was protecting the frontier of Mesopotamia while Romanus participated in the siege of Akhlat, but was defeated by the Turks who advanced deep into Cappadocia and Lycaonia. He was present at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, where he commanded a division of Romanus' army, and remained at the head of a considerable body of troops after the disaster. In the aftermath of the battle, he commanded the forces of the fortress Romanopolis, and on Romanus' death he assumed the title of Emperor. As the only remaining Byzantine general in the southeast he established a quasi-autonomous realm in the neighbourhood of Germanicia, which stretched from Cilicia to Edessa. In 1078 he agreed to abandon his imperial claims on condition that he be appointed duke of Antioch. 	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Vratislav_Bio	-	King Vratislav II	Vratislav II ruled Bohemia from 1061. He was a strong ally of Emperor Henry IV. He supported Henry stalwartly in both the Investiture Controversy, despite his good relations with the Holy See and attempts by the Pope to gain his support, and against the rebellions in Saxony. During the Saxon revolt of 1071, Poland attacked Bohemia, and in August 1073 Henry responded with an invasion of Poland, but a new Saxon revolt drew him back in 1075. Vratislaus joined him, and they defeated the rebels on 9th June at the First Battle of Langensalza, with the Bohemian troops showing conspicuous bravery. Vratislaus also took part in the wars against the German Anti-kings. At the Battle of Flarchheim only through the aid of Vratislaus's contingent was the imperial army capable of overcoming Rudolf of Rheinfelden. Vratislaus coveted the largely Slavic marches of Meissen and Lusatia, but, in spite of Henry's promises, he never received them. Despite his serving an excommunicated emperor, Vratislaus maintained good relations with the papacy.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Ruben_Bio	-	Ruben I	Ruben I was the first lord of Armenian Cilicia. Roupen was a commander in the armies of king Gagik II of Armenia. After the imprisonment of Gagik by Constantine IX, Roupen faithfully followed the king’s court into exile and resettled in the district of Caesarea in Cappadocia. However, upon the murder of Gagik II, Roupen gathered his family and fled to the Taurus Mountains, taking refuge in the fortress of Kopitar, the territory of the Armenians in the Taurus being hard of access and easy to defend. Roupen declared the independence of Cilicia from the Byzantine Empire in 1080. Relying mostly upon the remaining followers of King Gagik, he developed enough strength to descend gradually towards the heartland of the Cilician plain. He began leading bold and successful military campaigns against the Byzantines, topping his venture with the capture of the fortress of Pardzerpert which became a stronghold of the Roupenian dynasty. He became a vassal of Philaretos Brachamios, and together they greatly expanded the Armenian territories northward and eastward.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Abu_Bakr_Bio	-	Abu Bakr ibn Umar	Abu Bakr ibn Umar was a chieftan of the Lamtuna Berbers of the Western Sahara, and commander of the Almoravids from 1056. Abu Bakr was brother of Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni, who with the Maliki teacher Abdallah ibn Yasin launched the Almoravid movement in the early 1050s. Upon the death of Yahya ibn Umar in 1056, the spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin appointed Abu Bakr as commander of the Almoravids. He led the conquest of the Sous valley of southern Morocco from 1057-8. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yasin, Abu Bakr, now the sole commander of the Almoravids, conquered the Berghwata in a brutal campaign of revenge. He received control without the pretence of religious authority, taking up the comparatively modest title of amir al-Muslimin ("Prince of the Muslims"). He married the wealthiest woman in Aghmat, Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat, who helped him navigate the complicated politics of southern Morocco. But Abu Bakr disliked courtly life and in 1060 left the city and pitched his tents on the pastures along the Tensift River, setting up an encampment for their headquarters, as if they were back in the Sahara desert. Stone buildings would eventually replace the tents, and the encampment would become the city of Marrakesh. Abu Bakr placed his cousin Yusuf ibn Tashfin in charge of Aghmat, and assigned him the responsibility of maintaining the northern front. Discontent had arisen in the Almoravid ranks, particularly among the desert clans back in the Sahara, and after the fall of Fez, Abu Bakr decided it was time to return to the Sahara. He placed Yusuf in charge of Morocco, divorcing Zaynab before he left, and advised her to marry Yusuf if she needed protection. By the time of his successful return in 1072, Yusuf was reluctant to give it up power. Pushed by his new wife, Zaynab, Yusuf met Abu Bakr and persuaded him to abdicate the northern dominions to him. Abu Bakr returned to the Sahara desert to command the southern armies, launching a new campaign against the Ghana Empire in 1076.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Alan_Rufus_Bio	-	Alain Rufus	Alan Rufus ("Alan the Red") was a probable companion of William the Conqueror during the Norman Conquest and especially during Harrying of the North, in which he built Richmond Castle. He was the second son of Odo, Count of Penthièvre, by Agnes, daughter of Alain Cagnart, Count of Cornouaille, making him a cousin of William the Conqueror. He later became Earl of Richmond. His brother Brian was granted lands in Cornwall, but relinquished his own estates for a Breton wife and her dowry. At the time of his death, his wealth was noted as £11.000 (estimated at £81 billion in modern terms) and 7% of the net national income of England, making him the wealthiest Briton in history.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Anselm_Bio	-	Anselm of Canterbury	Anselm of Canterbury was a Benedictine monk, a philosopher, and a prelate of the church who held the office of Archbishop of Canterbury. Called the founder of scholasticism, he is famous as the originator of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Born into the noble family of Candia, he entered the Benedictine order at the Abbey of Bec at the age of twenty-seven, where he became abbot in 1079. He became Archbishop of Canterbury under William II of England. Anselm's writings represent a recognition of the relationship of reason to revealed truth, and an attempt to elaborate a rational system of faith. 	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Brian_of_Brittany_Bio	-	Brian of Brittany	Brian of Brittany was a Breton noble who fought for William I of England. He was the second (probably illegitimate) son of Odo, Count of Penthièvre, and brother of Alan Rufus. Brian is said to have commanded a band of Bretons with his brother at the Battle of Hastings.  At midsummer in 1069, Brian and Alan led a force that defeated a raid on Devon by Godwine and Edmund, sons of Harold Godwinson, who had sailed from Ireland where they were in exile. Later the same year, Brian and William fitz Osbern were sent to relieve sieges at Shrewsbury and Exeter by rebelling Englishmen. They were too late to save the former, but a sally by the defenders of Exeter drove the English into the path of Brian and William who "punished their audacity with great slaughter". Brian received grants of land in Suffolk and Cornwall. Brian's name is often associated with the construction of Launceston Castle. He left England for Brittany following the rebellion of Ralph de Gaël in 1075. 	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Eudes_de_Troyes_Bio	-	Eudes de Troyes	Eudes, Count of Champagne, was also Count of Troyes and of Meaux from 1047 to 1066, then Count of Aumale in Normandy from 1069 by right of his wife. He was still a minor at the death of his father, and his uncle Theobald III of Blois acted as regent of Troyes. His wife, Adelaide, was sister of William the Conqueror, and Eudes accompanied his brother-in-law in the Norman conquest of England. Theobald III of Blois then seized Eudes's counties in the Champagne region. For his services, William gave Eudes Holderness in Yorkshire.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Eustace_aux_Gernons_Bio	-	Eustace II	Eustace II was count of Boulogne and fought on the Norman side at the Battle of Hastings, and afterwards received a large honour in England. He is one of the few proven Companions of William the Conqueror. After joining the failed rebellion against Emperor Henry III in 1048 Eustace paid a visit to England in 1051, and was honourably received at Edward the Confessor's court. A number of events during the decade evidently caused a shift in Eustace's political allegiances, for he then became an important participant in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Sources suggest that Eustace was present with William at the Malfosse incident in the immediate aftermath of the battle, where a Saxon feigning death leapt up and attacked him, and was presumably cut down before he could reach William. In the following year, probably because he was dissatisfied with his share of the spoil, he assisted the Kentishmen in an attempt to seize Dover Castle. The conspiracy failed, and Eustace was sentenced to forfeit his English fiefs. Subsequently he was reconciled to the Conqueror, who restored a portion of the confiscated lands.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Geoffrey_deMontbray_Bio	-	Geoffrey de Montbray	Geoffrey de Montbray was bishop of Coutances, a right-hand man of William the Conqueror, and was a great feudal prelate, warrior and administrator at need. He was present on the battlefield of Hastings alongside bishop Odo, exhorting the Normans to victory, and at William's coronation it was he who called on them to acclaim their duke as king. His reward in England was a mighty fief scattered over 12 counties. He took a leading role in suppressing the wave of English rebellions which erupted in the late summer of 1069. While William marched north against the uprisings in Mercia and Northumbria, Geoffrey gathered troops from the forces occupying London, Winchester and Salisbury and led them to victory against the rebels besieging Montacute Castle in September 1069. In 1075 he again took the field against the Revolt of the Earls, leading alongside Bishop Odo a vast host against Ralph de Gael, whose stronghold at Norwich they besieged and captured.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Hamelin_deBallon_Bio	-	Hamelin de Ballon	Hamelin de Ballon was an early Norman Baron and the first Baron Abergavenny and Lord of Over Gwent and Abergavenny, titles granted shortly after the Norman Conquest of England and Wales by William the Conqueror. He was from France, from the ancient manor of Ballon, in the ancient province of Maine which was invaded and conquered by Duke William of Normandy in the early 1060s. Hamelin de Ballon was rewarded with land in Cornwall and in south east Wales, in what was to become the Welsh Marches, and charged with its speedy and successful conquest and management. He sited the early motte and bailey version of Abergavenny Castle and organised the early Norman protection of the settlement of what became the town of Abergavenny around 1075, founding the Benedictine Priory in the town and making it a defensible site.

Henry_I_Bio	-	Henry I	Henry I was the fourth son of William I of England. Henry was born in Selby in Yorkshire. His mother, Queen Matilda, named the infant prince Henry, after her uncle, Henry I of France. As the youngest son of the family, he was almost certainly expected to become a bishop and was given more extensive schooling than was usual for a young nobleman of that time. The saintly ascetic Osmund, Bishop of Salisbury, was in part responsible for Henry's education; Henry was consistently in the bishop's company during his formative years. "He was an intellectual, an educated man in a sense that his predecessors, excepting Alfred, were not." Henry once remarked that an illiterate king was a crowned ass.

Hugh_dAvranches_Bio	-	Hugh d'Avranches	Hugh d'Avranches, also known as le Gros (the fat) and Lupus (Wolf) was the first Earl of Chester  and one of the great magnates of early Norman England. He was the son of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches and Emma de Conteville, and inherited from his father a large estate, not just in the Avranchin but scattered throughout western Normandy.  Hugh became an important councillor of William, Duke of Normandy, and contributed sixty ships to the invasion of England. He did not fight at Hastings, instead being one of those trusted to stay behind and govern Normandy.  After William became king, Hugh was given the command of Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, but in 1071 he was promoted to become the first Earl of Chester, with palatine powers in view of Cheshire's situation on the Welsh border where he was to function as the main bulwark against the Welsh.

Odo_Bio	-	Odo, Earl of Kent and bishop of Bayeux	Odo was the half-brother of William the Conqueror, and was for a time second in power to the king of England. Although ordained a Christian cleric, he is best known as a warrior and statesman. He is one of the very few proven Companions of William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The Bayeux Tapestry, probably commissioned by him, appears to labour the point that he encouraged the troops from the rear.  In 1067, Odo became earl of Kent, and for some years he was a trusted royal minister, serving as de facto regent of England during William’s absence, and at times he led the royal forces against rebellions. During this time Odo acquired estates vaster than any in England except the king.  In 1076, however, Odo was tried  for defrauding the Crown and the Diocese of Canterbury, for which he lost the majority of his assets. His vast wealth was gained mainly by extortion and robbery. His ambitions were boundless and his morals lax. But he was, like many prelates of his age, a patron of learning and the arts and also a great architect.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
William_Conqueror_Bio	-	William the Conqueror	William I was the first Norman King of England, also Duke of Normandy. Before his conquest he was known as William the Bastard because of his illegitimate birth. To press his claim to the English crown, William invaded England in 1066, leading an army of Normans, Bretons, Flemings, and Frenchmen to victory over the forces of King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. "He was of just stature, extraordinary corpulence, fierce countenance; his forehead bare of hair; of such strength of arm that it was often a matter of surprise that no one was able to draw his bow, which he himself could bend when his horse was on full gallop; he was majestic whether sitting or standing, although the protuberance of his belly deformed his royal person: of excellent health so that he was never confined with any dangerous disorder except at the last." William was one of the foremost soldiers of the medieval era, conquering a large kingdom from a smaller base. He also created a feudal state with a strong central government.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
William_Rufus_Bio	-	William Rufus	William II, son of William I of England, is commonly known as William Rufus, because of his red-faced appearance. Although William was an effective soldier, he was a ruthless ruler and, it seems, was little liked by those he governed. William seems to have been a flamboyant character, and his reign was marked by his bellicose temperament. Relations between the three brothers had never been good and, at L'Aigle in 1077, William and Henry having grown bored with casting dice decided to make mischief by emptying a chamber pot onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father was forced to intercede to restore order. William Rufus was "well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting." 	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Wulfstan_Bio	-	Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester	Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, was the last surviving pre-Conquest bishop and the only English-born bishop after 1075.  His family lost their lands around the time King Cnut came to the throne. Wulfstan served as treasurer and prior of Worcester. Wulfstan was a confidant of Harold Godwinson, who helped secure the bishopric for him. A social reformer, Wulfstan struggled to bridge the gap between the old and new regimes, and to alleviate the suffering of the poor. William noted that pastoral care of his diocese was Wulfstan's principal interest. Wulstan was also responsible for stopping the slave trade from Bristol to Ireland. In 1075, Wulfstan and the Worcestershire levy helped put down the rebellion known as 'The Bridal of Norwich' of Ralph de Gael, Roger de Breteuil, and the Saxon Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Yusef_Tashfin_Bio	-	Yusef ibn Tashfin	Yusef ibn Tashfin was a great king of the Almoravid Empire. Yusuf emerged from a line of Berber military leaders. In a series of campaigns through the 1060s, while Abu Bakr ibn Umar held court in Marrakesh, Yusuf directed Almoravid armies against northern Morocco, reducing Zenata strongholds one by one. In 1070, the Moroccan capital of Fez finally fell to the Almoravids. Abu Bakr appears to have handed him leadership, and even went as far as to give Yusuf his wife, Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat. This sort of trust and favour on the part of a seasoned veteran and savvy politician reflected the general esteem in which Yusuf was held, not to mention the power he attained as a military figure in Abu Bakr’s absence. Daunted by Yusuf's newfound power, Abu Bakr saw any attempts at recapturing his post as politically unfeasible, and returned to the fringes of the Sahara to settle the unrest of the southern frontier. Yusef was an effective general and administrator, evidenced by his ability to organize and maintain the loyalty of the hardened desert warriors and the territory of Abu Bakr, as well as his ability to expand the empire, cross the Atlas Mountains onto the plains of Morocco, reaching the Mediterranean and capturing Fez in 1075, Tangier in 1079, Tlemcen in 1080.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Ralph_deGael_Bio	-	Ralph de Gael	Ralph de Gael was the Earl of East Anglia and Lord of Gaël and Montfort. He was the leading figure in the Revolt of the Earls, the last serious revolt against William the Conqueror. He inherited the great Breton barony of Gaël, and held large estates in Norfolk. He fought on the Norman side at the Battle of Hastings and in 1069 he routed a force of Norsemen which had invaded and occupied Norwich. In 1075, the king's refusal to sanction his marriage caused a revolt in William’s absence by Ralph, his new brother-in-law Roger de Breteuil, and Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northumberland. The revolt was plagued by disaster. Ralph encountered a much superior force under Odo of Bayeux and Geoffrey de Montbray near Cambridge and retreated hurriedly to Norwich, hotly pursued. He attained help from Denmark but was unable to achieve anything effectual. Ralph and his wife retired to their estate in Brittany and he was deprived of all his lands and of his Earldom. For the rest of his life he remained a great baron of Brittany, with no interests in England. In 1076 he plotted against Hoel II, Duke of Brittany, but was defeated with the aid of King William. After this Ralph finally made his peace with the King.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Raoul_deTosny_Bio	-	Raoul II de Tosny	Raoul II de Tosny, seigneur de Conches-en-Ouche, was a Norman nobleman of the house of Tosny, son of Roger I of Tosny. He was active in Normandy, England and Wales. He is one of the very few proven Companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Tradition says he gave up the role of standard bearer, his hereditary office, to Walter Giffard, in order to be able to fight closer to William. He had widely spread holdings, his seat being at Flamstead in Hertfordshire. He held Clifford Castle.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Robert_de_Conteville_Bio	-	Robert de Conteville	Robert, Count of Mortain and 1st Earl of Cornwall, was a Norman nobleman and the half-brother of William I of England and full brother to Odo of Bayeux.  He was made Count of Mortain in 1049 and five years later supported William against the French King Henri I's invasion of Normandy. Robert contributed 120 ships to the fleet for the invasion of England, and in all probability fought at Hastings. Robert was rewarded by the King for his part in the conquest with a large share of the consequent spoil. The greatest concentration of his landed wealth was in Cornwall, granted to him after 1072, when Brian of Brittany decided to return home.  In 1069, together with his cousin Robert of Eu, he led an army against a force of Danes who had laid siege to York. As the Norman forces approached the Danes retreated to the Fens, where they fancied they would be safe. But the two Roberts surprised the Danes whilst they were being entertained by the disaffected natives and "pursued them with great slaughter to their very ships".	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Robert_of_Normandy_Bio	-	Robert of Normandy	Robert of Normandy, nicknamed Curthose: meaning short stockings. King William called him brevis-ocrea (short-boot) in derision. In his youth he was reported to be courageous and skilful in military exercises, but also prone to a laziness and weakness of character. He was unsatisfied with the share of power allotted to him and quarrelled with his father and brothers fiercely.  In 1077, Robert instigated his first insurrection against his father as the result of a prank played by his younger brothers William Rufus and Henry, who had dumped a full chamber-pot over his head. Enraged, Robert started a brawl with his brothers only interrupted by the intercession of their father. When King William failed to punish his brothers, the next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize the castle of Rouen. When the siege failed Robert fled eventually to the court of his uncle Robert I, Count of Flanders, before causing such mayhem that his father allied himself with King Philip I of France to stop him. At a battle in January 1079 Robert unhorsed King William and wounded him, stopping his attack only when he recognized his father's voice. Humiliated, King William cursed his son and raised the siege. At Easter 1080, father and son were reunited by the efforts of Queen Matilda. 	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Roger_de_Breteuil_Bio	-	Roger de Breteuil	Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford, succeeded to the earldom of Hereford and the English estate of William Fitz-Osbern in 1071. He did not keep on good terms with William the Conqueror, and in 1075, disregarding the King's prohibition, married his sister Emma to Ralph Guader, Earl of Norfolk, at the famous bridal of Norwich. Immediately afterwards the two earls rebelled. Roger, who was to bring his force from the west to join forces with those of the Earl of Norfolk, was held in check at the River Severn by the Worcestershire fyrd which the English Bishop Wulfstan, Walter de Lacy and other Normans brought into the field against him. On the collapse of his confederate's uprising, Roger was tried before the Great Council, deprived of his lands and Earldom, in 1075 and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Roger_deMontgomerie_Bio	-	Roger de Montgomerie	Roger de Montgomerie was the first Earl of Shrewsbury and one of William the Conqueror's principal counsellors. He did not fight in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy. Afterwards he was entrusted with land in two places critical for the defence of England, receiving the rape of Arundel at the end of 1067, and in November 1071 he was created Earl of Shrewsbury. Roger was thus one of the half dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror's reign. William gave Earl Roger nearly all of what is now the county of West Sussex. 	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Thomas_Bayeux_Bio	-	Thomas of Bayeux	Thomas of Bayeux was Archbishop of York. A native of Bayeux, he was educated at Liège and became a royal chaplain to King William I of England. After Thomas' election, Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, demanded an oath from Thomas to obey him and any future Archbishops of Canterbury; this was part of Lanfranc's claim that Canterbury was the primary bishopric, and its holder the head of the English Church. Thomas countered that York had never made such an oath. As a result, Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. The King eventually persuaded Thomas to submit, but Thomas and Lanfranc continued to clash over ecclesiastical issues, including the primacy of Canterbury, which dioceses belonged to the province of York, and the question of how York's obedience to Canterbury would be expressed.	-	Naval	0	Admiral_of_France.tga	-	-	n/a	-

archbishop_of_esztergom		Esztergomi érsek	This man is the archbishop of Esztergom, making him the Primate (Prímása) of Hungary, the leader of all the clergy in Hungary (Primas Hungariae). The archbishops of Esztergom were from the 10th century onward (when the archdiocese was established) at the top of the Hungarian Church hierarchy. The archbishops of Esztergom preformed extremely important duties within the Kingdom such as: Hungarian Kings were only legitimate when they were crowned by archbishop of Esztergom, with the Holy Crown, in Székesfehérvár (Szekesfeheruuaru). They were the permanent emissaries of the Holy See in Hungary, and in many cases they were Cardinals in the college of Cardinals in Rome. They also preformed secular duties as well, such as commanding the military forces of Esztergom, administrative duties such as being the governor of the Esztergom area, they were one out of two people who inspected the minting of coins in the Kingdom, and other duties. During the middle ages the archdiocese itself nearly occupied all of the north-western regions of Hungary, with the exception of the diocese of Nyitra. From the river Danube to Moravia, and as far east as the Gömör and the Szepes region. Beyond this several monasteries and churches belonged to the archdiocese as well that were not within the boundaries of the Archdiocese itself throughout the Kingdom. The first ruler of the medieval Hungarian Kingdom, King István was crowned by Anasztáz-Asztrik in Esztergom as well.

archbishop_of_kalocsa		Kalocsai érsek	This man is the archbishop (érsek) of Kalocsa, making him the leader of the clergy in the archdiocese of Kalocsa.  In Hungary, the 'érsekek' or Archbishops were high ranking Bishops (out of which there were only two, the archbishop of Esztergom and Kalocsa) who led the clergy in specified territories within the Kingdom. The roots of the archdiocese can be traced to the emergence of the medieval Hungarian state. The territory on which the archdiocese was situated on was mostly populated by muslims and pagans, called in Hungarian as 'Kavarok' and 'Kálizok', or 'Fekete Magyarok' (Black Hungarians). These ethnic groups accepted the reign of King Stephen following the civil war which led to the establishment of the Catholic Kingdom of Hungary (that Stephen won), however they did not convert to Christianity. Following the coronation of King Stephen (1000) he established several dioceses, among which one of the first ones was the Kalocsai in early 11th century A.D. The first bishop of Kalocsa was Aserik-Anasztáz a famous benedictine monk in Hungary.	PSF title to be implemented	Court	1	bishop_of_pecs.tga	-	-	QPA	Piety +6, MovementPoints -70

Bailiff_of_Roden	-	Jarls bryti i RoÞs bo	The bailiff or 'bryte' could also mean "steward"- the word "bryte" comes from "to break," in the meaning of breaking bread, so "bryte" served the king personally at mealtimes- or at least ceremonially- just as a "steward". Roden was an important district in the early medieval era, being one of the major 'rowing stations'- hence the name. It is probably linked to the Finnic and Russian word for Swedes 'Ruotsi' or 'Rus'- literally meaning 'rowers'. Roden was one of the central royal districts for the King's own fleet. The Hovgården runestone dates to roughly 1070 AD, and seems to commemorate the Bryte of Roden, Tolir and his wife Gylla as servants of Håkan the Red.

bishop_of_csanad		Csanádi megyéspüspök	This man is the Bishop (Püspök) of Csanád, which makes him the leader of the diocese (Megyéspüspökség) of Csanád. In Hungary, the 'Megyéspüspökök' or diocesans were high ranking Bishops who led the efforts of the clergy in a specified region within the Kingdom. The diocese was established by King Stephen following his victory over the rebellious lord of the Maros Region, Ajtony. He captured the seat of power of the rebellious lord, Marosvár which was renamed to Csanád from which the diocese got it's name. King Stephen made the Venetian Gerard Sagredo (known in Hungarian as Szent Gellért) the Bishop of the diocese, who began to establish the foundations of the diocese. He transferred the Greek Orthodox monks from Csanád to Oroszlámos, and he established a school and archdeaconry. The cathedral in Csanád named after the Virgin Mary was supported by Queen Gizella the wife of the King. The territory of the diocese was between the rivers Maros, Tisza and the foothills of the Carpathian mountains.

bishop_of_eger		Egri megyéspüspök	This man is the Bishop (Püspök) of Eger, making him the leader of the diocese (Megyéspüspökség) of Eger. In Hungary, the 'Megyéspüspökök' or diocesans were high ranking Bishops who led the efforts of the clergy in a specified region within the Kingdom. The diocese of Eger was established by King Stephen, however the date of establishment is debated. According to tradition, Stephen was in Eger in 1010 when he commissioned the Cathedral and the establishment of the diocese. In the early stages, the territory of the diocese was limited to eight 'Vármegyék' (Castle-earldoms): Borsod, Abaújvár, Zemplén, Ung, Szabolcs, Zaránd, Szolnok and Heves. The patron saint of the diocese was Saint John the Evangelist. 	PSF title to be implemented	Court	1	bishop_of_gyor.tga	-	-	QPA	Piety +6, MovementPoints -70
bishop_of_erdely		Gyulafehérvári megyéspüspök	This man is the Bishop of the Diocese of Gyulafehérvár or Erdőelve, which makes him the leader of the clergy in Erdőelve (Transylvania).  In Hungary, the 'Megyéspüspökök' or diocesans were high ranking Bishops who led the efforts of the clergy in a specified region within the Kingdom. The diocese of Erdőelve is the only diocesan named after a geographical location, not after the center of the diocese itself (for example the diocese of Veszprém named after the capital of that diocese, Veszprém). The roots of the Diocese are to be searched during the early stages of the modern Hungarian state. Following the acceptance of Catholicism as the state religion, a large number of dioceses were established throughout the country. Transylvania, which was in it's self a secluded geographical entity within the Kingdom was at the forefront of the border clashes between the Hungarians and the Steppe nations. Therefore, the inhabitants who lived in secluded regions far away from the closest Clergy center could continue to pursue the ancient Hungarian religion, in spite of several laws prohibiting such acts.  The center of the Diocese was from the start located at Gyulafehérvár (medieval Hungarian: Gyulafeheruuaru) where King Stephen erected a cathedral.

bishop_of_gyor		Győri megyéspüspök	This man is the Bishop (Püspök) of Győr, which makes the leader of the clergy in the third oldest Diocese (Megyéspüspökség) established in Hungary by King Stephen, named after the center of the Diocese, Győr. In Hungary, the 'Megyéspüspökök' or diocesans were high ranking Bishops who led the efforts of the clergy in a specified region within the Kingdom. The exact date of the establishment of the diocese is unknown, but most likely it was sometime in the year 1001 A.D, when abbot Asztrik who was later became the Archbishop of Esztergom was sent to negotiate with pope Sylvester regarding the establishment of three dioceses (one of them being Győr) and the archdiocese of Esztergom. The area on which the diocese was established was formerly known as the Roman province of Pannonia Superior.

The diocese of Pécs was established in 1009 by King Stephen, with the city of Pécs providing both the capital and the name of the diocese. The exact charter that specified the boundaries of the diocese have been preserved. According to the document the exact boundaries are: the Sió, Lápa, Danube, Sava, Lisnice rivers, Lake Alma, the Vármegyék (Castle-Earldoms) of Baranya and Somogy, and the villages of Tápé and Zemony.

bishop_of_vac		Váci megyéspüspök	This man is the Bishop (Püspök) of Vác, making him the leader of the diocese of Vác (Megyéspüspök). In Hungary, the 'Megyéspüspökök' or diocesans were high ranking Bishops who led the efforts of the clergy in a specified region within the Kingdom. The establishment of the diocese is dated sometime after 1009 but before 1038 and it was established by King Stephen. The legend written about the life of Saint Stephen in 1080 specifies that he established ten dioceses, which means that most likely the diocese of Vác was established by him. This however was most likely the last diocese established during his lifetime, as the territory of this one was taken away from other dioceses, with parts being taken from the areas of the vármegyék (castle-earldoms) of Nógrád, Visegrád, Fejér, Csongrád and Szolnok.

bishop_of_varad		Váradi megyéspüspök	This man is the Bishop (Püspök) of Várad, which makes him the leader of the clergy in the diocese (megyéspüspökség) of Várad.  In Hungary, the 'Megyéspüspökök' or diocesans were high ranking Bishops who led the efforts of the clergy in a specified region within the Kingdom. The diocese was established by King Stephen in the early 1020's, during that time it was called the diocese of Bihar (Bihari megyéspüspökség) when Prince Imre was granted the lordship of the Dukátus of Bihar (the Principality of Bihar), from which the Vármegye (Castle-Earldom) of Bihar was born. In 1077 King László (Ladislaus) moved the capital of the diocese from Bihar to Várad, and according to Hungarian tradition (in which the diocese is named after the settlement where the capital of the institution is located) it was renamed to the diocese of Várad. The territory of the diocese was between the diocese of Eger and the diocese of Gyulafehérvár, or Erdőelve. The patron saint of the diocese was the Virgin Mary.

bishop_of_veszprem		Veszprémi megyéspüspök	This man is the Bishop (Püspök) of Veszprém, making him the leader of the diocese (Megyéspüspökség) of Veszprém, the second oldest diocese in Hungary.  In Hungary, the 'Megyéspüspökök' or diocesans were high ranking Bishops who led the efforts of the clergy in a specified region within the Kingdom. The diocese of Veszprém was always close to the Queens of Hungary. Even in the time of Grand-Prince Géza, (father of the first Hungarian King Stephen) Veszprém was already regarded as the 'City of Queens'. According to legend, the Church institutions themselves were established by Gizella, the wife of Stephen, which Stephen later elevated to the rank of Diocese. The territory of the diocese was quite large, streching from the river Drava all the way to the Danube. The Bishop of Veszprém was the Church official who crowned the Queens, and they served as Chancellors to the Queen. The decision regarding whether or not the Archbishop of Esztergom or the Bishop of Veszprém should crown the King decided forever in Hungary that the Queens would be limited to the function of being the wife of the King, not a ruler in case the King would pass away prematurely without heirs. Usually the Bishops of Veszprém were also high ranking diplomats, as many diplomatic missions were undertaken by them.

Count_of_the_Szeklers	-	Székelyek Ispánja	This man is the "Székelyek Ispánja" (english: Earl of the Szeklers lat. Comes Siculorum), which means he is the commander in chief of the Szekler forces, and he is the highest judicial authority in Székelyföld (Szeklerland). His duties include: collecting taxes in Szeklerland, when war comes to Hungary, he leads the Szekler forces in battle, he leads the annual gathering of the Szekler bírák (justices, who represent their own "szék" [hold]) where matters of great importance regarding Szeklerland are discussed, he takes part in electing new justices, and as the highest judicial figure in Szeklerland, any arguments that cannot be settled by the bírák are brought before him, the collection of tariffs, he oversaw the salt, silver and gold mines belonging to the king, and he is also responsible for collecting census data. The rank is first mentioned in 1235, but it was in existence well before that, and untill the 13th century, they were usually not of Szekler ethnicity .The Szeklers are a people of debated origin, who speak a dialect of the Hungarian language, and they have their own runic writing. According to their legends, they are the descendants of Attila's huns, and although this is debated, it is certain that they were present during the Avar period, and they were already inhabiting the Carpathian basin when the Magyars arrived to the Carpathian basin. The Székelys were regarded as the finest warriors of medieval Transylvania. They were skilled horse archers, and they made up a large part of the hungarian light cavalry divisions. They were tasked with guarding the borders of Hungary from eastern and southern threats. Most of the Szeklers live in Transylvania, in the medieval times they were split up into seven "szék"-s (holds). Each hold elected their own Bíra (Justice) who participated in the annual gathering of the Szeklers. The institution of serfdom was unkown amongst the Szeklers, they regarded themselves as equals.

Following his assignment, the King sent messengers to the county to request the obedience of the nobility within the county. The duties of the Főispán within a county included: defending the rights and freedoms of the people living within the county, enforcing the various bulls and laws enacted by the King, the collection of the various royal regalias such as tariffs, salt taxes and other incomes gained from mining precious metals, as well as leading the county's forces during wartime. His income was made up out of the following: 1/3 of all tariffs collected within his county were his, as well as 2/3 of the fines collected during judicial cases (however he split up this money between his assistants).

grand_master_of_the_order_of_saint_george_hungary	-	A Szent György Vitézei Lovagrend Nagymestere	This man is the Grandmaster of The Order of St. George (Hungarian: Szent György Vitézei Lovagrend), which was the first secular chivalric order in the world established by King Charles I of Hungary in 1326. The Grand Master of the order were always the monarchs of Hungary. The order consisted of 50 members, and it's primary missions were: the defense of Christianity, the promotion of christian festivities, the defense of the weak and the meek, and also the defense of the royal family and the court. These activies resulted in the members of the order being the companions of the King during knights tournaments, and they guarded the holy crown during the 1323 Visegrád assembly. Unlike the ecclesiastical Orders of the period, members of the Society wore black, knee-length, hooded mantle bearing not a device (shield) but rather a peculiar inscription bearing the words "IN VERITATE IUSTUS SUM HUIC FRATERNALI SOCIETATE" which is translated to "In truth I will do justice to this fraternal society". The order flourished during the reign of Charles and achieved greater success under the reign of his son Louis I of Hungary. After the death of Louis, the Hungarian throne became the subject of a violent dispute between his relations and the Hungarian kingdom dissolved into civil war destroying the original Society.

grand_master_of_the_order_of_the_dragon	-	Societas Draconistrarum Nagymestere	This man is the Grand Master of the Order of the Dragon (Hungarian: Sárkány Lovagrend Latin: Societas Draconistrarum). The symbol of the order is a dragon choking itself, symbolizing the willingness of the members to sacrifice themselves to help others. The order was established by King Sigismund of Hungary and his queen Barbara of Celje on December 12, 1408. The Grand Masters of the order were always the monarchs of Hungary. The order was initially establish to strengthen the ties between the barons and the King. Later however, after Sigismund became Holy Roman Emperor in 1433, many foreigners including three monarchs (King Henry V of England, King Ladislaus II of Poland and Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania) and several important figures were invited to join the order. The duties of the order according to the statute of the Order states the following: "in company with the prelates, barons, and magnates of our kingdom, whom we invite to participate with us in this party, by reason of the sign and effigy of our pure inclination and intention to crush the pernicious deeds of the same perfidious Enemy, and of the followers of the ancient Dragon, and (as one would expect) of the pagan knights, schismatics, and other nations of the Orthodox faith, and those envious of the Cross of Christ, and of our kingdoms, and of his holy and saving religion of faith, under the banner of the triumphant Cross of Christ ...". The patron saints of the order were Saint George and Saint Margaret. The symbol of the order (worn by all the members of the order) was a green dragon with golden scales, with a red cross above it's wings were the latin text: O Q MISERICORS EST DEUS IUSTUS ET PACIENS (O how merciful is God, faithful and just).The symbols of the order were incorporated into the coat of arms of several nobles, such as Vlad II who's son, Vlad Tepes (better known as Dracula) got the nickname draco (dragon) from the symbol.  Initially the order was composed of only 21 members, which was later expanded to 24, and then to unlimited members, however the order was broken up into two classes: there was a superior class, which between 1408 and 1418 wore both the dragon and the cross as the Order's emblem and a more elaborate version afterwards. The second degree had a large amount of members, and its symbol was only the dragon. The order followed the example set by contemporary orders such as the Order of the Garter in England. Following Sigismund's death in 1437, the Order lost prominence.

As this task was quite important, the position was always held by high ranking clergymen such as bishops.

He guarded and pressed the Royal seal on important documents. The clergy serving in the Royal Chapel was supervised by the Archbishop of Esztergom who could intervene into the day to day matters of the bureau. Although his title would suggest a secular background (Earl of the Royal Chapel), he was a member of the clergy. Beyond issuing documents for the state the supervision and organization of the celebrations of important liturgical events was headed by him as well. Historically by the spread of literacy in the Kingdom and the need for more and more documents led to the establishment of the Royal Chancellery, also headed by a member of the clergy.

Hungarian_Count_Palatine	-	Nádorispán	This man has been appointed to the office of Nádor. The "Nádor" or "Nádorispán" is the greatest authority in the country after the king. This office was created by St. Stephen. It is named after, and is very alike to the Frank "pfalzgraf" or Palatine/Master of the Palace. At first, the Nádor was only responsible for the managment of menial tasks in the court such as accomodation, food and drink and the like. Later, the powers were expanded, the Nádor became a court judge: anyone who had a quarrel with another noble, had to come and present his/her case to the Nádor. Later, this expanded to the entire country, meaning anyone who had a quarrel had to come before the Nádor, making him the chief judicial authority in the kingdom (with the exception of a few ethnic centers that had their own chief judge such as the Saxons and the Szeklers). He also oversees and organizes the diet of the realm. Therefore the post was seperated, the Nádor still remained a prominent figure and outranked the "Országbíró" or Chief Justice, but not all law cases were presented to the Nádor, only those of the greatest importance. In the absence of the King (during campaigns, or crusades) the Nádor became governor of the country. The most noteable Nádor is Sámuel Aba, who after the death of Saint Stephen became king.

hungarian_factionheir	-	Herceg	The Herceg (Prince) is the designated heir to the throne of Hungary in medieval times. However, in Hungary, the importance and power of the Princes was quite different compared to western Europe. The Prince was the lord of the "Tercia pars regni" (i.e., one-third part of the kingdom) or Ducatus (Dukátus). The symbol of the ducal power was a sword, while the royal power was represented by the crown. The exact borders of the "Tercia parsi regni" have not been determined yet. The counties entrusted to the members of the ruling dynasty did not form a separate province within the kingdom, but they were organized around two or three centers.The eastern block of the counties were located around Byhoriensis, a city that was also the see of a Roman Catholic diocese in that time. The north-western parts of the territories were centered around Nyitra. A third possible center of the territories was Kraso (near the southern border). The dukes' principal hunting-grounds lay in the "Holy Forest" (Igyfon) on the territory of the Erdélyi-Szigethegység in Transylvania.

The various landowners and lords answered to him, not to the King. They could organize and upkeep military forces of their own for defensive purposes. Historically the Banates were located to the south of Hungary.

Following the successful first Crusade and the reclaiming of Jerusalem, pilgrims in the numbers of thousands began to flock to the holy city. The need for hospitals and shelters along the land route towards the holy land for the pilgrims, knights and soldiers also grew, and in response the order was established sometime between 1150 and 1160 by King Géza II of Hungary. The center of the order was the hospital located in Esztergom, which was named after Saint Stephen, a Hungarian king (he established the medieval Hungarian Kingdom) that became the first sanctified monarch in the history of the world. The order was therefore named after the Saint King. It's members were however not exclusively from Hungary. Both secular men and clergymen were allowed to join the order, if they followed the strict Christian values promoted by Saint Stephen as well as the 13 knightly virtues, in accordance with the regulations of Saint Augustine of Hippo. The ranks within the order were: the "várománoyosok" or members who were waiting to be knighted, the "Lovag" or Knight, and from the Knights anyone could became a Master of his chapter. The Grandmaster of the order is elected by these Masters. According to the order, the greatest knightly virtue was love, with the duties of the order being specified as: the defense of the holy Church, the protection of Christianity and the faithful service of God.

The Knights of the Golden Spur were not a secular or monastic order, and they did not have any specific mission, or duties, it was simply a ceremonial title that was granted to nobles of high stature during the crowning of a new monarch in Hungary. The name derives from the fact that during their inauguration, they had to wear golden spurs on their boots. The new knights were granted a sword, a golden necklace and a purple dress. The title was awarded to those who proved themselves on the field of battle. It seems the knights had a ceremonial position, as they were present during diplomatic talks between monarchs, and they were the bodyguards of several Hungarian princesses.

In Hungary, the central stud was at Csepel Island, but they were the royal stud farms around the royal estates as well. Horses were required for the army, the royal messengers and for the court itself. Along the borders between counties, there were stations with horses, so the messengers of the court could change horses and continue to travel without stopping. This was a position of high honor, as the King of Hungary had the biggest force in the country, which was mainly cavalry, and his soldiers were given horses from the King's horse studs. His duties also included organizing the accommodation of the members of the nobility who had to participate in the annually held diets.

If he visited a nobleman personally, and did not send one of his subordinates, then the nobleman had to come immediatley to the court. He is also responsible for the safety of the King during court sessions, therefore he is the master of the guard as well. One of the legends surrounding the Ajtónállómester's is the legend of the Crown and the Sword. King Andrew the Ist of Hungary was on his deathbed. His son, Salamon was still young. His brother, Béla wanted the throne for himself. Andrew summoned Béla, and asked him a question: the crown, or the sword? (The Crown representing the Kingdom, and the Sword representing the Principality, a title given usually to young heirs, who were given 1/3 of the Kingdom to rule upon.) The Ajtónállómester, according to legend told Prince Béla to choose the Sword, because If he chose the crown, Andrew would have had him killed. Therefore Béla chose the Sword, but as soon as Andrew died, he usurped the throne for himself.

Nordic_chancellor_den	-	Umbuðsmann	An Umbuðsmann was a modernistic office in Sweden and Denmark but the name seems to be very old meaning literally -'messenger' and may have grown out of a simple emissary position. First recorded in Denmark in the Jutish Lawbook Jyskelagen in 1241 as umbozman, the office was a local one referring to a sheriff in each community responsible for gathering taxes and maintaining law. However in the King's own company a national Umbuðsmann held the rank of a formal Prime Minister or Chancellor with control over the kingdom's economy, law and general government.

Order_of_the_Dragon	-	Societas Draconistrarum	This man is a member of the Order of the Dragon (Hungarian: Sárkány Lovagrend Latin: Societas Draconistrarum). The symbol of the order is a dragon choking itself, symbolizing the willingness of the members to sacrifice themselves to help others. The order was established by King Sigismund of Hungary and his queen Barbara of Celje on December 12, 1408. It was to some extent modelled after the earlier Hungarian monarchical order, the Order of St. George (Societas militae Sancti Georgii), founded by King Charles I in 1318. The statute of the Order states the following about the order: "in company with the prelates, barons, and magnates of our kingdom, whom we invite to participate with us in this party, by reason of the sign and effigy of our pure inclination and intention to crush the pernicious deeds of the same perfidious Enemy, and of the followers of the ancient Dragon, and (as one would expect) of the pagan knights, schismatics, and other nations of the Orthodox faith, and those envious of the Cross of Christ, and of our kingdoms, and of his holy and saving religion of faith, under the banner of the triumphant Cross of Christ ...". The patron saints of the order were Saint George and Saint Margaret. Members of the order, known as "Draconists", are referred to in the statutes as barons (barones, occasionally socii). They were mostly Sigismund's political allies and supporters, who were at first largely confined to the political factions of Stefan Lazarević, Nicholas II Garay and Hermann II of Celje, including such local magnates as Stibor of Stiboricz and Pipo of Ozora. The Order was established initially to promote the defense of Catholicism during the Hussite rebellion, but later it became instrumental in uniting against the Ottomans. The symbol of the order (worn by all the members of the order) was a green dragon with golden scales, with a red cross above it's wings were the latin text: O Q MISERICORS EST DEUS IUSTUS ET PACIENS (O how merciful is God, faithful and just). Initially the order was composed of only 21 members, but soon the order became popular, even European monarchs such as King Henry V of England, King Ladislaus II of Poland and Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania were members. As membership grew, the Order of the Dragon came to have two degrees. There was a superior class, which between 1408 and 1418 wore both the dragon and the cross as the Order's emblem and a more elaborate version afterwards.The second degree had a large amount of members, and its symbol was only the dragon. Another note-able member of the order is the Vlad II. who adopted the Dragon symbol into the family coat of arms, which made his son, Vlad Tepes better known as Dracula adopt the nickname draco (dragon). Following Sigismund's death in 1437, the Order lost prominence. 	PLACEHOLDER EFFECTS DESCRIPTION	Security	0	Order_of_the_Dragon.tga	-	-	QMO	Authority +1, Command +1, LineOfSight +1, TrainingAgents -1

Papal_Legate	-	Legatus natus	This man is a Papal Legate designated to represent the Holy See in Hungary. Papal Legates were designated by the Pope himself to oversee missions or diplomatic talks iniated by the Papacy. They were usually chosen from Bishops. There is a difference however in the exact task of certain Legates. The Apostolic Nuncios task is to strengthen relations between the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church in a particular country and at the same time to act as the diplomatic representative of the Holy See to the leader of that pacticular country. Apostolic Delegates For nations with which the Holy See has no diplomatic ties, an Apostolic Delegate is sent to serve as a liaison with the Roman Catholic Church in that nation. Legate Missus: literally "sent legate", possessing limited powers for the purpose of completing a specific mission - this commission is normally focused in scope and of short duration. In the Middle Ages, papal legates often summoned legatine councils, which dealt with church government and other ecclesiastical issues.

Persian_grand_emir	-	Omarāʾ-e ʿeẓām	The Timurid administration was organized in two main branches, the top personnel of which consisted of tovāčībegīs (Pers. tovāčī), military inspectors, and of dīvānbegīs, respectively. These two amir-/beg-groups together constituted the grand amirs (omarāʾ-e ʿeẓām), with the title oloḡ beg. The chiefs of both branches were called amīr al-omarāʾ (q.v.), which explains why in Timurid sources two amīr al-omarāʾ are sometimes reported as having simultaneously served a single ruler. The office of the dīvānbegīs, i.e., dīvān-e aʿlā, is already attested under Tīmūr (771-807/1370-1405), but the earliest mention of the office of tovāčībegīs (i.e., dīvān-e tovāčī, dīvān-e laškar, or tork dīvānī) is after the reign of Šāhroḵ (807-50/1405-47). Other synonyms for dīvān-e aʿlā were dīvān-e molk wa māl, dīvān-e māl, and sart dīvānī according to the Mongol customary law (yāsā, tūrā), the omarāʾ-e dīvān-e māl ranked second after the omarāʾ-e dīvān-e tovāčī.

Persian_minister_of_war	-	ʿĀreż al-ǰayš 	In the administration of the Great Saljuqs, the department of the ʿĀreż al-ǰayš was a constituent of the great dīvān of the vizier, with the usual task of ensuring that the army was an efficient fighting force and with important responsibilities regarding the eqtāʿs which supported the soldiers financially. The office of ʿāreż was not infrequently the stepping-stone to the supreme offices of vizier and chief secretary; the historian Anūšervān b. Ḵāled progressed in the early 6th/12th century from being ʿāreż for Moḥammad b. Malekšāh to becoming vizier for Maḥmūd b. Moḥammad. The office of ʿāreż passed, whether under that name specifically or a synonymous one, to the successor states in Iran of the Great Saljuqs. Nūr-al-dīn Monšī’s collection of letters, the Wasāʾel al-rasāʾel, compiled for the brother of the Ḵᵛārazmšāh Jalāl-al-dīn Mingburnu, contains the investiture diploma for an ʿāreż. The institution is found amongst the Mongol Il-khanids as the ʿārez Âµ or amīr-e ʿāreż, whilst for the Turkmen dynasties arising in Iran after the Il-khanids, we possess a detailed account of an ʿarzÂµ under the Āq Qoyunlū in the later 9th/15th century, in which the Amīr Uzun Ḥasan’s son Solṭān Ḵalīl, governor of Fārs, passed in review 23,000 troops, the provincial army of Fārs, at Band-e Amīr near Persepolis 	PLACEHOLDER EFFECTS DESCRIPTION	Politics	1	Persian_Insider.tga	-	-	QMR	Authority +1, MovementPoints +30, Command +2, TrainingUnits -2, BattleSurgery +2

Persian_superintendent	-	Nāẓer-e boyūytāt	The superintendent of the royal workshops (nāẓer-e boyūytāt) was responsible for the entire royal household (sarkār-e ḵaṣṣa-ye šarīfa) and supervised the overall operation of its departments. He was among the most powerful and influential court amirs, carried the title ʿālījāh (highness), and had the right to sit at court gatherings. At first this office could be held only by qezelbāšes, but subsequently Shah Solaymān and Shah Solṭān Ḥosayn bestowed it only on white eunuchs (ḵājagān-e safīd). The nāẓer-eboyūtāt was not only responsible for the purchase, storage, and preparation of all supplies, but he also oversaw the baths and the stables, evaluated the presents, and super­vised all the department heads (ṣāḥeb-jamʿān) within the boyūtāt. Once a year he inspected the personnel of the boyūtāt, confirmed salaries, and granted leaves. Immediately subordinate to the nāẓer, or perhaps on the same level, was the wazīr-e boyūtāt, who conducted him on his tour of inspection and was responsible for overseeing bureaucratic routine. The control of all financial transactions of the boyūtāt—including those conducted by the nāẓer—fell under the direction of the mostawfī-e arbāb-e taḥāwīl.

Polish_Royal_standard_Bearer	-	Chorąży wielki koronny	A royal banner was used as early as the reign of Boleslaus the Generous (r. 1076-1079). The earliest mention of a banner (Polish: chorągiew) bearing the sign of an eagle is found in Wincenty Kadłubek's Chronicle which says that Duke Casimir the Just fought the Ruthenians in 1182 "under the sign of the victorious eagle". A seal of Duke Premislaus II from 1290 shows the ruler holding a banner emblazoned with a crowned eagle. Five years later, Premislaus was crowned King of Poland, and he made the crowned White Eagle a national coat of arms. During the reign of King Ladislaus the Elbow-High (r. 1320–1333), the red cloth with the White Eagle was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland (Polish: chorągiew Królestwa Polskiego).

the_order_of_saint_george_hungary	-	A Szent György Vitézei Lovagrend	The Order of St. George Hungarian: Szent György Vitézei Lovagrend, was the first secular chivalric order in the world established by King Charles I of Hungary in 1326. The Order, being the earliest known secular chivalric order in Europe was founded by King Charles I of Hungary as the Fraternal Society of Knighthood of St. George. The order consisted of 50 members, and it's primary missions were: the defense of Christianity, the promotion of christian festivities, the defense of the weak and the meek, and also the defense of the royal family and the court. These activies resulted in the members of the order being the companions of the King during knights tournaments, and they guarded the holy crown during the 1323 Visegrád assembly. Unlike the ecclesiastical Orders of the period, members of the Society wore black, knee-length, hooded mantle bearing not a device (shield) but rather a peculiar inscription bearing the words "IN VERITATE IUSTUS SUM HUIC FRATERNALI SOCIETATE" which is translated to "In truth I will do justice to this fraternal society". The order flourished during the reign of Charles and achieved greater success under the reign of his son Louis I of Hungary. After the death of Louis, the Hungarian throne became the subject of a violent dispute between his relations and the Hungarian kingdom dissolved into civil war destroying the original Society.

Basil_Apokapes_Bio	-	Basil Apokapes	Basil Apokapes was a Byzantine general of the 11th century. A descendant of the Apokapai family, an Armeno-Georgian noble clan, he was the son of the patrician Michael Apokapes who had once served as a tent-guard for the influential Georgian Bagratid prince David of Tao (r. 966–1000) and then commanded the city of Edessa under the Byzantine Emperor Michael IV the Paphlagonian (r. 1034–1041). In 1054, as patrikios and strategos, Basil Apokapes rallied the people of Manzikert and repulsed an attack by the Seljuks under Toğrül. Later, from 1059 to 1065, he served as archon (magistros and doux) of Paradounavon. In 1064, together with the future emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates and his sons, he was defeated and captured by the Oghuz Turks who had crossed the northern Balkans, but the outbreak of epidemic soon decimated the invaders and the prisoners were recovered. After the defeat of Romanos IV by Andronikos Doukas in 1071, he served under the command of Philaretos Brachamios, and served him as a governor of Edessa.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Oshin_Lampron_Bio	-	Oshin Lambronatsi	Oshin of Lampron (Armenian: Oshin Lambronatsi) was an Armenian nakharar ("holder of the primacy", a hereditary title of the highest order given to houses the Armenian nobility). He was formerly a lord of a fortress near the city of Gandzak (in modern Azerbaijan), who migrated in the early 1070s to Cilicia and founded the House of Lampron. A member of the Pahlavuni clan, who, disappointed with the inability of the Byzantines to protect him against the advance of the Seljuk Turks, fled west from his fortress to Cilicia in 1072, with his brother Halgam, and his wife and other nobles, carrying his wealth and the finger of the holy apostle Peter. His kinsman, Abulgharib Artsruni (governer of Taurus and Mopsuestia in the name of the Emperor Alexius I Comnenus), ceded to Oshin two forts in western Cilicia, Lampron and Barbaron at Tarsus near the Cilician Gates. The Emperor had no objection to seeing the Armenians becoming a buffer between him and the invading Seljuks, and confirmed Oshin, together with two other Armenian leaders who had established themselves in the Taurus, Ruben and Gogh Vasil, in their positions by bestowing on them the imperial title of sebastos.

Knud_Estridsen_Bio	-	Canute IV	Canute IV, known as Canute the Holy or Canute the Saint (Danish: Knud IV den Hellige or Sankt Knud), was King of Denmark from 1080. Canute was an ambitious king who sought to strengthen the Danish monarchy, devotedly supported the Roman Catholic Church, and had designs on the English throne. Born c. 1042, as one of the many illegitimate sons of Sweyn II Estridsson, he is first noted as a member of Sweyn's 1069 raid of England, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Canute was one of the leaders of another raid against England in 1075. When Sweyn died, Canute's brother Harald III was elected King, and, as Canute went into exile in Sweden, was possibly involved in the active opposition to Harald. In 1080, Canute succeeded Harald to the throne of Denmark and on his accession he married Adela, daughter of Count Robert I of Flanders. 	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

Toirdhealbhach_Ua_Briain_Bio	-	Toirdelbach Ua Briain 	Toirdelbach Ua Briain was King of Munster and effectively High King of Ireland. A grandson of Brian Bóruma, Toirdelbach was the son of Tadc mac Briain who was killed in 1023 by his half-brother Donnchad mac Briain. It was not until the 1050s that he found allies in Connacht and in Leinster, particularly the powerful King of Leinster Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, who would aid his claims to be ruler of Munster. It took perhaps ten years of sustained attack to remove his uncle Donnchad from power, and send him into exile, and to place Toirdelbach in power in Munster as Diarmait's faithful ally. On Diarmait's death Toirdelbach took over the reins of power, establishing himself as ruler of more than half of Ireland. While not a great military leader, he was a capable politician whose influence extended as far north as Ulaid and who made and unmade Kings of Connacht. 	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Gofraid_Crovan_Bio	-	Godred Crovan 	Godred Crovan was a Norse-Gael ruler of King of Mann and the Isles. In 1079, Godred invaded the Isle of Man three times. The last time, having collected a large body of followers, he came by night to the port of Ramsey and concealed his 300 men in a wood on the sloping brow of a hill. At daylight the men of Mann drew up in order of battle, and, with a mighty rush, encountered Godred. During the heat of the contest the 300 men, rising from the ambuscade in the rear, threw the Manxmen into disorder, and compelled them to fly.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

His period of Caliphate lasted for 60 years, the longest of all the caliphs, either in Egypt or elsewhere in Islamic states. 	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

Ethnically an Armenian, he was purchased by a Syrian emir, Jamal ud-Dawla, for a relatively small price and converted to Islam. Later he joined the Mamluks and was later appointed as the governor of Acre during his service. He was appointed Commander of the Armies in 1074 making the de facto ruler of the Fatimid empire, his authority being over everything except the Caliphate.

Philip_FL_Capet_Bio	-	Philip I	Philip I, called the Amorous, was King of the Franks from 1060. Under Philip, the monarchy was beginning a modest recovery from the low it reached in the reign of his father. He was the son of Henry I and Anne of Kiev. Unusually at the time for Western Europe, his name was of Greek origin, being bestowed upon him by his mother. Although he was crowned king at the age of seven, until age fourteen his mother acted as regent, the first queen of France ever to do so. Her co-regent was Baldwin V of Flanders. A great part of his reign, like his father's, was spent putting down revolts by his power-hungry vassals, and in 1077 he made peace with William the Conqueror, who gave up attempting the conquest of Brittany.

Robert_de_Flandre_Bio	-	Robert I of Flanders 	Robert I of Flanders was count of Flanders from 1071. He was the younger son of Baldwin V of Flanders and Adèle, a daughter of King Robert II of France. Robert was initially intended to secure the northern borders of Flanders through his marriage to Gertrude of Saxony, Countess of Holland. However, after the death of his brother Baldwin VI in 1070, he rebelled against Baldwin's widow, Richilde, and son, Arnulf III. Arnulf's ranks contained individuals such as William FitzOsborn, Count Eustace II of Boulogne and his son, Godfrey of Bouillon, and moreover was supported by the King. But Robert attacked Arnulf's numerically superior army at Cassel before it could organize. Arnulf himself was killed along with William FitzOsborn, while Richilde was captured. However, Robert himself was captured by Eustace II and ultimately, was exchanged for Richilde. After his victory, Robert became count of Flanders and gained the friendship of King Philip by offering the marriage of his stepdaughter, Bertha of Holland.

Foulques_dAnjou_Bio	-	Fulk IV	Fulk IV, called le Réchin (possibly meaning either "quarreler", "rude", "sullen", "surly") was the Count of Anjou from 1068. Fulk fought continuously with his elder brother, Geoffroy III of Anjou, whose rule was deemed incompetent, and Fulk captured him in for good in 1068. His brother’s poor rule lost substantial territory for Anjou, and Fulk had to give the Gâtinais to Philip I of France to placate the king. Much of Fulk's rule was spent regaining control over the Angevin baronage, and to a complex struggle with Normandy for influence in Maine and Brittany.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

However, Aragon lost the city again in the following years. During William VIII's rule, his alliance with the southern kingdoms of Spain was a political priority, as shown by the marriage of all his daughters to Iberian kings.

Theobald conspired against king Henry I, but was beaten in 1044 and had to give up the county of Tours to regain his freedom. From then on the centre of power for the House of Blois moved to Champagne. Theobald found ways to become close to the royal court again and gain influence. He got the title of Count Palatine, which his father had used before.

He minted his own money in his capital of Morlaas, and was freed from nominal ties of vassalage by the Duke of Aquitaine. He was the only person with the right to call on the knights of Béarn, who owed fealty to none but him. Centule was a great participant in the Gregorian reform and he maintained excellent relations with the Holy See. Though the Pope exhorted him to break his marriage on grounds of consanguinity, he obediently did in 1074.  He made many donations to the church and initiated the construction of the church of Santa Fe de Morlaas. Pope Gregory VII referred to him as a lover of justice, defender of the poor; and propagator of peace. Through strategic marriages, Centule expanded his control to include his western neighbours Bigorre and Montaner, and solidified an alliance with his royal neighbour to the south, the Crown of Aragon.

Heinrich_i_Bio	-	Henry IV	Henry IV was King of the Romans, from 1056, and Holy Roman Emperor, the third emperor of the Salian dynasty. Only six years old when he succeeded to the throne, his mother, Agnes of Poitou, became regent. But in 1062 government was placed in the hands of archbishop Anno II of Cologne after he captured the young king. The education and training of Henry were supervised by Anno, but his education was neglected, and his willful and headstrong nature developed under the conditions of these early years. Eventually Henry managed to obtain control of Anno’s civil duties, leaving Anno with only ecclesiastical powers. In the late 1060s, Henry demonstrated his determination to reduce any opposition and to enlarge the national boundaries, quelling rebellions by Rudolf of Swabia and Berthold of Carinthia, as well as Otto of Nordheim, duke of Bavaria. The tension between Empire and Church over reformation culminated in the councils of 1074–1075. Suddenly hostile to Pope Gregory, Henry did not relent from his positions. Henry was excommunicated for the first time, but it was lifted in January of 1077. After his reconciliation with the Pope, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, two-time brother-in-law of Henry, along with allied German nobles, took advantage of the momentary weakness of the king and declared Rudolf Anti-king in March. After the inconclusive battle of Mellrichstadt (7 August 1077) and the defeat of Henry's forces in the Flarchheim (27 January 1080), the Pope switched his support to the revolt, and launched a second excommunication against Henry in March 1080. On the 14th October 1080, the armies of the two rival kings meet at the Weisse Elster River in the plain of Leipzig.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
rGodfrey_von_Bouillon_Bio	-	Godfrey of Bouillon	Godfrey of Bouillon was the Lord of Bouillon from 1076. He was born around 1060, the second son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, and Ida of Lorraine (daughter of Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine). As second son, he had fewer opportunities than his older brother, and seemed destined to become just one more minor knight in service to a rich landed nobleman. However, his uncle on his mother's side, Godfrey the Hunchback, Duke of Lower Lorraine and son of Godfrey III, died childless and named his nephew, Godfrey of Bouillon, as his heir and next in line to his duchy of Lower Lorraine. This duchy was an important one, serving as a buffer between the kingdom of France and the German lands. In fact, Lower Lorraine was so important to the German kingdom and the Holy Roman Empire, that Henry IV decided in 1076 that he would place it in the hands of his own son and give Godfrey only Bouillon and the Mark of Antwerp, in the Duchy of Brabant, as a test of Godfrey's abilities and loyalty. Godfrey served Henry loyally, supporting him even when Pope Gregory VII was battling the German king in the Investiture Controversy. Godfrey also fought with Henry and his forces against the rival forces of Rudolf of Swabia.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Magnus_Billung_Bio	-	Magnus of Saxony	Magnus was the duke of Saxony from 1072. Eldest son and successor of Ordulf and Wulfhild of Norway, he was the last member of the House of Billung. In 1070 he joined Otto of Nordheim, duke of Bavaria, in rebellion against Emperor Henry IV. The rebellion was put down in 1071, and Magnus was captured. Magnus was imprisoned in the castle of Harzburg, the imposing imperial fortress which so inflamed the Saxon freemen. He was not released upon his accession to the Saxon duchy until seventy Swabians captured in Lüneburg were released. In 1073, Harzburg was destroyed and the anger of Henry aroused. He renewed the conflict with Saxony once more. At the First Battle of Langensalza in 1075, Magnus was captured again. After being released again, he joined Rudolf von Rheinfeld, duke of Swabia and antiking, and was present at the Battle of Mellrichstadt (7 August 1078), where he saved Rudolf's life. However, he and the Saxons never fully supported the Swabian Rudolf and he reconciled with Henry.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
rDirk_sfg_Bio	-	Dirk V	Dirk V was Count of Holland from 1061. He succeeded Floris I under the guardianship of his mother, Gertrude of Saxony. William I, Bishop of Utrecht, took advantage of the young ruler, occupying territory that he had claimed in Holland, supported by the emperor. In 1063 Gertrude married Robert of Flanders, second son of Baldwin V. Robert gave Dirk the Imperial Flanders as an appanage and then became his stepson's guardian, making Robert indirectly the ruler of all Frisia. The death of Baldwin VI in 1070 led to civil war in Flanders and Holland, which became part of the larger conflict engulfing the empire from 1075 onwards, with the count of Holland supporting Pope Gregory VII and anti-king Rudolph. While Robert was thus engaged in Flanders, an effort was made to recover the County of Holland and other lands now held by William I, Bishop of Utrecht. The people rose in revolt, but were brought back under Episcopal rule by an army under the command of Godfrey IV (the Hunchback), duke of Lower Lorraine, by order of the emperor. In 1076, at the request of William of Utrecht, Godfrey IV visited his domains in the Frisian borderland. At Delft, Godfrey IV was murdered by revolutionaries, but William of Utrecht then died on April 17, 1076. Dirk V, now managing his own estate, was quick to take advantage of this favourable juncture. With the help of Robert of Flanders, he raised an army and besieged Conrad of Utrecht, the successor of William, in the castle of Ysselmonde, taking him prisoner. The bishop purchased his liberty by surrendering all claim to the disputed lands.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

Giorgi_II_Bagrationi_Bio	-	George II Bagrationi	George II of the Bagrationi Dynasty, was king of Georgia from 1072. George’s childhood consisted of civil war between his father, Bagrat IV, and the rebellious feudal lord Liparit, who became the master of nearly half of the Georgian kingdom and the most powerful dynast in the country. By 1060, Bagrat IV had secured the throne and made George his heir apparent to whom the Byzantine emperor attached the title of curopalates. In 1070, Prince George, at the head of a combined Georgian-Alan army, inflicted a decisive defeat on the Shaddadid emir of Arran, Fadl II. George succeeded as King of Georgia upon the death of his father in 1072 and received the title of nobelissimos and later that of sebastos from the Byzantine emperor. A year later, he faced a major aristocratic revolt led by Niania Kvabulis-dze, Ivane Liparitis-dze, and Vardan of Svaneti. Although victorious, the king had to buy the rebels’ loyalty through generously awarding them additional estates. Soon, Georgia was attacked again by the Seljuks. Following the 1073 devastation of Kartli Sultan Alp Arslan, George successfully repelled an invasion commanded by the Turkish general left in charge of the Caucasus. The king also secured the formal return of Upper Tao/Tayk, a frontier region which had been a bone of contention between Georgia and the Byzantine Empire early in the 11th century, by the Byzantine governor, Gregory Pakourianos, who began to evacuate the region shortly after the 1071 disaster inflicted by the Seljuks on the Byzantine army at Manzikert. On this occasion, George was bestowed with the Byzantine title of Caesaros, granted the fortress of Kars, and put in charge of the Imperial Eastern limits.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Orzocorre_Torchitorio_Bio	-	Orzocorre Torchitorio I	Orzocorre Torchitorio I was the Judge of Cagliari (rex Sardiniae de loco Call.) from 1058. During his time, the throne was customarily alternated between the Torchitorio de Ugunale and Salusio de Lacon families, Orzocorre being of the former. Torchitorio was judge at a time when Western monasticism was being introduced into Sardinia as part of the Gregorian reform of the Papacy. Cagliari, like the other giudicati, was placed under papal and Pisan authority. Torchitorio severely increased donations to the church and lent support to the monks of Monte Cassino who were arriving on the island to bring economic, technological, and religious renewal. He was also directed by Pope Gregory VII to force the clergy of the Archdiocese of Cagliari to shave their beards and attend to their churches, which the pope claimed were in neglect.

Olav_Olavsson_Bio	-	Olaf III of Norway	Olaf III of Norway, or Olaf Haraldsson, was King of Norway from 1067. During his rule, he made peace with earlier royal conflicts against the church and strengthened the power of the monarchy. He was present at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 where his father, Harald Hardrada, saw defeat and was killed. However, being only sixteen years old, he stayed on board ship and did not participate in the fighting. After the death of his father, Olaf shared the kingdom with his brother Magnus Haraldsson. When Magnus died during 1069, Olaf became sole ruler. During his reign the nation experienced a rare extended period of peace, as he renounced any offensives in foreign policy and sort to protect Norway as a kingdom of its own. This included preventing an attack by the Danish king Svend Estridsen through the marriage of his daughter, and making peace with William the Conqueror. Olaf also strengthened the power of the king and instituted the system of guilds in Norway. There are strong indications that the government of King Olaf began writing secure provincial laws to a greater extent. Handsome and of noble appearance, he was “taciturn for the most part”, though known to be merry after drinking. “He was cheerful in conversation, peacefully inclined during all his reign, and loving gentleness and moderation in all things."

Nikephoros_Botaneiates_Bio	-	Nikephoros III Botaneiates	Nikephoros III Botaneiates was Byzantine emperor from 1078, claiming descent from the Byzantine Phokas family. Botaneiates had served as general from the reign of Constantine IX. Drawn to politics, he had been an active participant in the uprising that brought Isaac I to the throne in 1057. Although considered a competent general, he suffered a number of humiliating setbacks throughout his career, such as suffering the humiliation of capture in 1064 defending the Balkan frontiers against Oghuz Turks. Excluded from Romanos's campaign at Manzikert, he retired to his estates in Anatolia, but eventually, under Michael VII Doukas, he became strategos of the Anatolic theme and commander of the troops in Asia Minor. Here he participated in the shambolic acts that crippled the empire’s eastern provinces, including his strategic retreat during John Doukas’s confrontation with Norman mercenary rebels, resulting in the humiliating defeat of the Byzantine army, and the capture of John Doukas. In 1078 he revolted against Michael VII and his finance minister Nikephoritzes, and with the support of the Seljuk Turks, marched upon Nicaea, proclaiming himself emperor. In the face of another rebellious general, Nikephoros Bryennios, his election was ratified by the aristocracy and clergy, while Michael VII abdicated and became a monk. On 24 March 1078, Nikephoros III Botaneiates entered Constantinople in triumph and was crowned by Patriarch Kosmas I of Constantinople. With the help of his general Alexios Komnenos, he defeated Bryennios and other rivals, but failed to clear the invading Turks out of Asia Minor. Nikephoros' administration did not win him much support, and almost immediately the uprisings began, and consequently, Nikephoros quickly became increasingly dependent on the support of his general, Alexios Komnenos.

Alexios_Komnenos_Bio	-	Alexios I Komnenos	Alexios I Komnenos was the son of the Domestic of the Schools, John Komnenos and Anna Dalassena, and the nephew of Isaac I Komnenos (emperor 1057–1059). Alexios's father declined the throne on the abdication of Isaac, who was accordingly succeeded by four emperors of other families from after 1059. Under one of these emperors, Romanos IV Diogenes (1067–1071), Alexios served with distinction against the Seljuq Turks. Under Michael VII Doukas (1071–1078) and Nikephoros III Botaneiates, he was also employed, along with his elder brother Isaac, against rebels in Asia Minor, Thrace, and in Epirus. In 1074, the western mercenaries led by Roussel de Bailleul rebelled in Asia Minor, but Alexios had successfully subdued them by 1076. In 1078, he was appointed commander of the field army in the West by Nikephoros III. In this capacity, Alexios defeated the rebellions of Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder and Nikephoros Basilakes, first at the Battle of Kalavrye and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp. Alexios was ordered to march against his brother-in-law Nikephoros Melissenos in Asia Minor but refused to fight his kinsman. This did not, however, lead to a demotion, as Alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the Normans of Southern Italy, led by Robert Guiscard.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Isaakios_ii_Komneno_Bio	-	Isaac Komnenos	Isaac Komnenos was a notable Byzantine general in the 1070s and one of the major supporters Alexios I Komnenos, who was his younger brother. Isaac was the second-eldest son of the Domestic of the Schools, John Komnenos, and Anna Dalassene. As such he belonged to the highest aristocracy of Byzantium, being the nephew of Emperor Isaac I Komnenos (r. 1057–1059). In 1072 the Emperor Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–1078) married him to Irene, a Georgian princess and cousin to Michael's empress, Maria of Alania. In the 1070s, following the disaster of the Battle of Manzikert, Isaac was employed as military commander in Anatolia against the Seljuk Turks. In 1073, as Domestic of the Schools of the East, he was captured by the Turks and was released only after ransoming. In the next year, he was again sent East, as doux of Antioch, where he quelled local unrest, but was again captured by the Turks and had to be ransomed by the citizens of the city. During the reign of Nikephoros III Botaneiates he enjoyed the emperor's favour, and plotted at court, using his influence with Empress Maria to advance the position of the Komnenos clan; especially that of his younger brother Alexios.

Nikephoros_Melissenos_Bio	-	Nikephoros Melissenos	Nikephoros Melissenos was a general and aristocrat of distinguished lineage, born circa 1045 at Dorylaeum, where his family held extensive estates. His father belonged to the Bourtzes line while his mother to the illustrious Melissenos family. Sometime before 1067, Nikephoros married Eudokia Komnene, the second daughter of John Komnenos, and sister of Alexios I Komnenos. Melissenos held the rank of magistros and the post of governor of Triaditza for some time during the 1060s, and in 1070 joined the field army commanded by his eldest brother-in-law, the protostrator Manuel Komnenos, in a campaign against the Seljuk Turks, which nonetheless ended in defeat near Sebasteia. Melissenos remained loyal to Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–1078) during the rebellion of Nikephoros Botaneiates which began in October 1077. Michael VII rewarded him by appointing him to Botaneiates's post as strategos of the Anatolic Theme, but after Botaneiates's victory and entry into Constantinople in April 1078, Melissenos was exiled to the island of Kos. In 1080, Melissenos left Kos and returned to Asia Minor. There he succeeded in gaining the support of the local population, and in recruiting many Turkish tribesmen as mercenaries to his army. One by one, the cities of western and central Asia Minor opened up their gates to him. But Alexios Komnenos, having been commanded by the emperor to subdue him, refused to fight his kinsman, and Melissenos continued to serve Alexios faithfully throughout the rest of his life, agreeing to march alongside Alexios in his campaign against the Normans of Robert Guiscard.

Nikephoros_Palaiologos_Bio	-	Nikephoros Palaiologos	Nikephoros Palaiologos, the first known member of the Palaiologos family, is first attested as Doukas partisan and hostile to Romanos IV Diogenes (r. 1068–1071) becoming a member of the opposition around the Caesar John Doukas and Michael Psellos. After the fall of Romanos following the Battle of Manzikert, Nikephoros was dispatched east against the Norman mercenary Roussel de Bailleul, who had rebelled against imperial rule. After gathering some 6,000 mercenaries in Georgia, he confronted Roussel, but his Georgian troops defected and he was defeated. In 1077, he is recorded as doux of Mesopotamia. Although loyal to the Doukas dynasty and Emperor Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–1078), he did permit his son George to join the rebellion of Nikephoros Botaneiates, who became emperor as Nikephoros III.

Nikephoros_Bryennios_Bio	-	Nikephoros Bryennios	Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder was a general considered by his contemporaries as the best tactician in the empire. Nikephoros had steadily risen through the ranks of the military, and given an important command by Romanos IV at Manzikert. Commanding the left wing, he was one of the few generals who performed well at the battle. In 1072–1073, he served as doux of Bulgaria, where he reimposed Byzantine control after a series of uprisings, and was afterwards elevated to the position of doux of Dyrrhachium. In 1077, Nikephoros became disgusted with Michael VII's treaty with the Seljuk Turks, whereby large swathes of Anatolia were handed over to them, and decided that Michael was ineffective and inept. Assembling an army of Thracians, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Sclavonians, Italians, Franks, Uzes and Greeks, his forces reached the walls of Constantinople in November 1077. He allowed his troops to plunder and burn the city's suburbs. The thereby producing an opposition to his claims and allowing the detested Michael to force him to raise the siege and retreat into Thrace. His political weaknesses allowed Nikephoros III Botaneiates to become emperor, who offered Bryennios the title of Caesar if he would submit to him. Bryennios refused to do so, and Botaneiates sent the young Alexios Komnenos against him with an army composed of Greeks, Franks and Turkish cavalry. Despite possessing a significantly superior army, Bryennios was defeated, captured, and subsequently blinded. As he no longer posed a threat, Nikephoros III allowed his estates and property to be returned to him, and gave Bryennios new honours, after which Bryennios retired to his base at Adrianople.

At the suggestion of his mother-in-law he wrote a history ("Materials for a History") of the period from 1057 to 1081, beginning with the victory of Isaac I Komnenos over Michael VI. The work has been described as a family chronicle rather than a history, the object of which was the glorification of the house of Komnenos.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

Olegk_Svyatoslavich_Bio	-	Oleg Svyatoslavich	Oleg Svyatoslavich of Chernigiv, sometimes also styled as ‘of Tmutarakan’, was a Rurikid prince whose equivocal adventures ignited political unrest in Kievan Rus' at the end of the 11th century. One of the sons of Sviatoslav II of Kiev, in the 1070s he ruled the towns of Rostov and Lutsk, whence he made a raid into Bohemia in 1076. That same year his father died in Kiev, and was succeeded by his brother Vsevolod. Failing to get along with him, Oleg had to flee to the distant Chernihivian domain on the Black Sea shore, called Tmutarakan. There, in 1078, he made an alliance with the Kipchaks, and with their support returned to his father's patrimony, Chernihiv. It was the first time that Slavic princes, in order to achieve their ends, brought pagan hordes to the walls of Russian cities. On October 3, 1078 Oleg's forces clashed with Vsevolod of Kiev at the Nezhatinnaya Niva. He was defeated and escaped to Tmutarakan, where the Khazars had him imprisoned and sent in chains to Constantinople. The emperor, who was a relative and ally of Vsevolod, exiled him to Rhodes, where he married a noble lady, Theophano Mouzalonissa, before returning once more to Tmutarakan.

He was the son of Vsevolod I and Anastasia of the Eastern Roman Empire (d. 1067). Eupraxia of Kiev, a half-sister of Vladimir, became notorious all over Europe for her divorce from the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV on the grounds that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body. In his famous Instruction (also known as The Testament) to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg Svyatoslavich of Chernigiv, but ceased after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigov.

Vsevolod_Yaroslavich_Bio	-	Vsevolod I Yaroslavich	Vsevolod I Yaroslavich was the fourth and favourite son of Yaroslav I the Wise by Ingigerd Olafsdottir. Upon his father's death in 1054, he received in appanage the towns of Pereyaslav, Rostov, Suzdal, and the township of Beloozero. Together with his elder brothers Iziaslav and Sviatoslav he formed a sort of princely triumvirate which jointly waged war on the steppe nomads, polovtsy, and compiled the first East Slavic law code. In 1067 Vsevolod's Greek wife died and he soon married a Kypchak princess, Anna. She brought him another son and two daughters, one being Eupraxia of Kiev, who married Emperor Henry IV. Upon Sviatoslav's death in 1076, Vsevolod inherited the Kievan throne, but ceded it to the banished Iziaslav in return for his patrimony of Chernigov. But Iziaslav died two years later, and Vsevolod took the Kievan throne yet again. Vsevolod was versed in Greek learning and spoke five languages. Since he lost most of his battles, his eldest son, Vladimir Monomakh, a grand and famous warrior, did most of the fighting for his father. Last years of his reign were clouded by grave illness, and Vladimir Monomakh presided over the government.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Yaropolk_i_Izyaslavich_Bio	-	Yaropolk Izyaslavich	Yaropolk Izyaslavich was a Knyaz in the Kievan Rus' kingdom and was the King of Rus (1076–1078), the son of Grand Prince Izyaslav Yaroslavich by a Polish princess named Gertruda. During his father's exile in the 1070s, Yaropolk acted on his father's behalf in an attempt to gain the favour of the German emperors and the papal court of Pope Gregory VII. His father returned to Kiev in 1077 and Yaropolk followed. After his father's death Yaropolk was appointed Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia and Prince of Turov in 1078 by the new Grand Prince, his uncle Vsevolod. In 1054, Yaropolk became the son of the Grand Prince, as Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev. Izyaslav's rule and thus Yaropolk's security were challenged by Izyaslav's brothers, Svyatoslav, Prince of Chernigov, and Vsevolod, Prince of Pereyaslavl and in 1073 Izyaslav was expelled from the Kievan throne. At Mainz in early 1075, Izyaslav sought the aid of King Henry IV of Germany, and sent Yaropolk to Rome to request aid from Pope Gregory VII, but to no avail. It was only after Svyatoslav's death in late 1076 that Izyaslav was able to recover the status of Grand Prince. Yaropolk aided his father and uncle in 1078 when Oleg Svyatoslavich attempted to gain the throne of Chernigov from Vsevolod, but Yaropolk's father died as a result of the battle. After his uncle Vsevolod had become Grand Prince, Yaropolk was given Vladimir-in-Volhynia and Turov, while Monomakh received Chernigov.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Sesnando_Sesnandes_Bio	-	Sisnando Davides	Sisnando Davides was a Mozarab nobleman and military leader of the Reconquista, born in Tentúgal, near Coimbra. He was educated in Córdoba by Muslims after being captured during a raid by Abbad II al-Mu'tadid of Seville and taken into his service, becoming known as Shishnando.

In the following years the towns of Galicia from Guimarães down to Coimbra were captured from the Moors, the latter on Sisnando's advice, with Sisnando leading the siege and being granted the countship of the region south of the Douro from Lamego to the sea after his success. He took the title aluazir (vizier) de Coimbra. Sisnando continued in the service of Ferdinand's successor, Alfonso VI. 	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-
Mael_Coluim_mac_Mail_Choluim_Bio	-	King Malcolm III of Scotland	Malcolm III was the eldest son of King Duncan I. Duncan's reign was not successful and he was killed by Mac Bethad mac Findlaích in 1040. Soon after the death of Duncan his two young sons were sent away for safety. Mac Bethad was succeeded by his stepson Lulach in 1057, but Lulach was killed by Malcolm, and after this, Malcolm became king. Malcolm married the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Ingibiorg, and they had a son, Duncan II. Malcolm's marriage to Ingibiorg secured him peace in the north and west. Malcolm was not directly involved in the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, though in 1068, he did grant asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy. However, the exiles were disappointed if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots. In 1069 these exiles returned to England, to join a spreading revolt in the north. Malcolm took the opportunity to lead his army south into Cumbria and across the Pennines, wasting Teesdale and Cleveland then marching north, loaded with loot, to Wearmouth, before returning home. In reprisal, William sent Gospatric to raid Scotland through Cumbria. In return, the Scots fleet raided the Northumbrian coast where Gospatric's possessions were concentrated. In 1072, with the Harrying of the North completed and his position again secure, William of Normandy came north again, defeating Malcolm at Abernethy. Malcolm handed over his eldest son Duncan as a hostage and accepted the overlordship of the English king, though this arrangement meant little in reality.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

Malik-Shah_Bio	-	Sultan Malik-Shah I	Malik-Shah I (full name: Muizz ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Jalal ad-Dawlah Hasan Malik-Shah ibn Muhammad) succeeded his father, Alp Arslan, as the Sultan of the Seljuq Empire in 1072. In 1064, he took part in Alp Arslān’s campaign in the Caucasus. The same year, he was married to Turkan Khatun, the daughter of the Kara-Khanid khan, Ibrahim Tamghach-Khan. Following his father's assassination, Malik was challenged in battle by his uncle, Qawurd-Beg. In January 1074, their armies met near Hamadan, Qawurd-Beg's troops consisting of the traditional Turkmen elements from Alp Arslan's army, while Malik's consisted of ghulams and contingents of Kurdish and Arab troops. Due to Turkmen defections to Malik's army, Qawurd was defeated and, despite Malik's consideration for mercy, later poisoned, presumably on the orders of vizier Nizam al-Mulk. Although Malikshah was the nominal head of the Seljuq state, his famous vizier Nizam al-Mulk held near absolute power during his reign. Under Nizam's guidance the Seljuq armies contained the Ghaznavids in Khorasan, rolled back the Fatimids in Syria, defeated the Seljuq pretenders to the throne, invaded Georgia, compelled the submission of regional governors, and kept the Abassid Caliphs in a position of impotence. In 1075, the Jalāli calendar was reformed and throughout Malik's reign new institutions of learning were established throughout the Seljuq lands.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

Alfonso was allotted León when the kingdom was divided following his father's death. Castile was given to his elder brother Sancho and Galicia to his younger brother García. Alfonso appears to have taken the first step in violating this division. But he was defeated by Sancho in the Battle of Golpejera in early January 1072, and forced to flee to Toledo. However, later that year as Sancho was mopping up the last of the resistance, he was assassinated, opening the way for Alfonso to return to claim Sancho's crown. García, was imprisoned by Alfonso for life, leaving Alfonso in uncontested control of the territories of their father.

Pedro was one of the nobles closest to Alfonso VI of León and Castile, even accompanying Alfonso into exile in 1072. During 24 July–3 September 1067 Pedro served as the majordomo of Alfonso's court. He was raised by the king to the rank of count perhaps as early as 22 November 1068. Later, when Alfonso returned to inherit the kingdoms of León and Castile, Pedro was charged with the repopulation of Valladolid. This he did with men from the counties of Saldaña and Carrión. However, the city really began to grow when its lordship was given to Pedro some years later. He became a prolific builder, constructing a large palace for himself and his wife, and a hospital. He built a bridge over the Pisuerga and many religious edifices, like the church of Santa María la Antigua and the Colegiata de Santa María, which served as the site of the cathedral. The environs of Valladolid formed the outer limits of the Kingdom of Castile at his time and Pedro was responsible for the repopulating of the region between Liébana and Cuéllar. His massive frontier district included the historically significant city of Toledo.	No Effect	Naval	0	civil_admin.tga	-	-	n/a	-

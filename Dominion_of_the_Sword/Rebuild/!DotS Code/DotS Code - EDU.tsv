mongol_lancers	The Already Dead (Suicide troops)	Mangudai	The Mangudai or Mungadai were a military unit of the Mongol Empire, but sources differ wildly in their descriptions.  Some source's make reference to Mongol light cavalry 'suicide troops' date back to the 13th. century.  While Marco Polo believed that the Men-gu-dai was a singular persona.  The most likely explanation of the Mangudai is as follows: Mangudai when translated means literally 'God belonging', and could be understood as 'already with God'. Meaning 'already dead', a smart way to think of yourself when you are acting as a lure to the enemy.  Mangudai ranks were made wholly of volunteers - in a society with a fierce warrior ethic, the chance to prove your bravery was highly coveted.  It may also be noted that some historians believe that these men came from two specific Mongol tribes, the Uru'ut and Maghut, known for there utter fearlessness.  But essentially, the Mangudai were suicide troops.  When an enemy force was located, the Mangudai armed only with bows, arrows and light shield and armor, would ride ahead of the main force and attack the foe recklessly.  Enticing the  enemy to chase when they realized that the Mangudai's numbers were quite few, luring them into a well planned trap.  This strategy would be used to devastating effect at the battle of Leignitz.

alan_horse_archers	Alan guard	Assud Khishigten	The Asuud guard were a guard and military group of Alani origin. The Mongol clan Asud is the plural of As, the Arabic name for the Alans. After the Mongol invasion of Rus, many Alans submitted to the Mongol Empire and served the Mongol monarchs as auxiliaries in battle after the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria in 1236; they participated in the Mongol invasion of Europe. Many warriors moved from Northern Caucasa to Mongolia. Under the rule of Mongke Qan, they fought against the Chinese Song Dynasty and Nanchao in Yunnan in 1258-1259. The Alan imperial guard was divided into 2 corps with headquarters in Karakorum. After the coronation of Qubilai Qan, those Alans participated in the campaign against Ariq Boke and later Qaidu under the Yuan Dynasty. They suffered heavy losses from Song resistance when they were under the command of Bayan of the Baarin and Aju. Qubilai Qan organized them into the Jasin guard (Alan guard) of 3,000 soldiers around 1271, along with some of the Kipchaks. The Alani guard reached its peak during the reign of Tugh Temur and their number expanded to 30,000.

andalucian_berber_warriors	Andalucian Berber warriors	Ghumarah	Hamet Zeli, surnamed El Zegri, was the commander of the belligerent city of Ronda and its fierce inhabitants. He was of the tribe of the Zegries, and one of the most proud and daring of that warlike race. Besides the inhabitants of Ronda and some of his own tribe, he had a legion of African Moors in his immediate service. They were of the tribe of the Gomeres, so called from their native mountains--mercenary troops whose hot African blood had not yet been tempered by the softer living of Spain, and whose whole business was to fight. These he kept always well armed and well appointed. The rich pasturage of the valley of Ronda produced a breed of horses famous for strength and speed; no cavalry, therefore, was better mounted than the band of Gomeres. Rapid on the march, fierce in the attack, it would sweep down upon the Andalusian plains like a sudden blast from the mountains, and pass away as suddenly before there was time for pursuit.

anglo_scottish_reivers	Border Reivers 	Reivers 	Border Reivers were raiders along the Anglo–Scottish border during the Middle Ages and until the Early Modern Period. They were conscripted into armies due to their superb reputation as skilled light cavalrymen, although many were enlisted as a punishment for their crimes rather than by choice. Some also served as mercenaries to make money. England and Scotland were frequently at war during the late Middle Ages, and during these wars, the livelihoods of the people on the borders were devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in both kingdoms was often weak. The uncertainty of existence meant that communities or peoples kindred to each other would seek security through their own strength and cunning, and improve their livelihoods at their nominal enemies' expense. As such, reivers from different nations sometimes fought alongside each other - although, many were neither Scottish nor English per se but had relatives on both sides of the border, and even outside the army they raided throughout the area without regard to their victims' nationality. Loyalty to a feeble or distant monarch and reliance on the effectiveness of the law usually made people a target for depredations, rather than conferring them any security. 'Reive' is an early English word for 'to rob', from the Northumbrian and Scots Inglis verb 'reifen' from the Old English 'rēafian', and thus related to the archaic Standard English verb 'reave' ('to plunder', 'to rob').

bombard	Bombard?	Bombard	A bombard is a large-caliber, muzzle-loading medieval cannon or mortar, used chiefly in sieges for throwing heavy stone balls. The name bombarde was first noted and sketched in a French historical text around 1380. The modern term bombardment derives from this. Bombards were usually used during sieges to hurl various forms of missile into enemy fortifications. Projectiles such as stone or metal balls, burning materials and weighted cloth soaked in quicklime or Greek fire are documented. The name derives from medieval Latin and French forms from a Greek word expressing the making of a humming noise. A notable example of a bombard is the large Mons Meg weapon, built around 1449 and used by King James II of Scotland. It was very powerful and used for bringing down castle walls. Mons Meg was capable of firing 180 kg (396 lb) shots and was one of the largest bombards in its time. The Dardanelles Gun, built in the Ottoman Empire in 1464 by Munir Ali, with a weight of 18.6 t and a length of 518 cm, was capable of firing stone balls of up to 63 cm diameter.

brit_scouts	Cavalry vanguard	Outrideres	A cavalry vanguard expert in reconnaissance, escort and picketing attested in Middle English although first records of the term date to the 1500s. They were 'commandos' acting as scouts and raiders ahead or in flanking to the main force of an invading army on manoevre rather than in battle itself. Western medieval armies did not move in convoy but in a broad front which could be up to 30 miles across, depending on the size of the forces involved. This front would swarm over fields and villages, surrounding them and allowing them to pillage and enslave everything and everyone in sight. The outriders would keep watch for enemy movements but also guide the army towards high value targets. They would also hunt and eliminate enemy scouts that could warn the enemy of the army's approach. They could ride ahead and encircle a settlement until the army arrived, anyone trying to flee would be ensnared by the outriders. These riders were especially well known in the forces of the English and the Scots who were both notorious for raids and campaigns of prolonged devastation over the borders. The English also practiced this tactic in Ireland to great effect and even in France where the limited and often isolated forces needed outriders to survive and avoid the enemy. They were essential in finding locations and routes most famously for the retreat of Henry V's troops at Agincourt in 1415, but even earlier under Edward III at Crécy in 1346 as well as the Siege of Calais begun in the same year. The word has cognate forms in German as Autraider and Vorreiter.

byzantine_bogomils	Bogomil Dissidents	Massaliani	In 970 the emperor John I Tzimiskes transplanted no less than 200,000 Armenian Paulicians to Europe and settled them in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis (today's Plovdiv in Thrace) and it is thought that their Manichean beleifs had a major influence on the Bogomils. According to Slavonic documents, the founder of this sect was a certain priest Bogumil, who 'imbibed the Manichaean teaching and flourished at the time of the Bulgarian emperor Peter' (927-968). The Slavonic sources are unanimous on the point that his teaching was Manichaean. A Synodikon from the year 1210 adds the names of his pupils or 'apostles,' Mihail, Todur, Dobri, Stefan, Vasilie and Peter. Zealous missionaries carried their doctrines far and wide. In 1004, scarcely 25 years after the introduction of Christianity into Kievan Rus, we hear of a priest Adrian teaching the same doctrines as the Bogomils. He was imprisoned by Leontius, Bishop of Kiev. In 1125, the Church in the south of Rus had to combat another heresiarch named Dmitri. With the massive influx of Armenian refugees from the Turkish invasion and Byzantine persecutions, many fled into Russia and the situation was protracted. The Church in Bulgaria also tried to extirpate Bogomilism, in response several thousand went in the army of Alexios I Komnenos against the Norman, Robert Guiscard; but, deserting the emperor, many of them (1085) were thrown into prison. The Bogomils spread westwards and settled first in Serbia; but at the end of the 12th century Stefan Nemanja, Great Župan of Serbia, expelled them from the country. Large numbers took refuge in Bosnia, where they were known under the name of Patarenes or Patareni. In the 12th and 13th century, the Bogomils were already known in the West as 'Cathars' or in other places as 'Bulgari', i.e. Bulgarians (българи). In 1207 the Bulgarorum heresy is mentioned. In 1223 the Albigenses are declared to be the local 'Bougres', and in the same period mention is made of the 'Pope of the Albigenses who resided within the confines of Bulgaria'. The Cathars and Patarenes, the Waldenses, the Anabaptists, and in Russia the Strigolniki, Molokani and Doukhobors, have all at different times been identified with the Bogomils. The word 'Cathar' is derived from the Greek 'Katharos' (meaning 'pure') On multiple tombstones in Bosnia they are clearly shown as armoured archers.

byzantine_crossbowmen	Byzantine Marines (elite melée crossbowmen)	Karabisianoi 	In the 650s, Constans II established the corps of the Karabisianoi (Greek: Καραβισιάνοι, 'the Ships' Men'), possibly from the remainders of the old quaestura exercitus or the Army of the Illyricum. It was headed by a naval stratēgos (stratēgos tōn plōimatōn), and included the southern coast of Asia Minor from Miletus to Seleucia in Cilicia, the Aegean islands and the imperial holdings in southern Greece. Its headquarters was initially perhaps at Samos, with a subordinate command under a droungarios (naval commander) at Cibyrrha in Pamphylia. As its name suggests, it comprised most of the Empire's standing navy, and faced the principal maritime threat, the Arab fleets of Egypt and Syri. The Karabisianoi however were soon (by 720) replaced by maritime themata. The Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots or Kibyrrhaiotai (θέμα Κιβυρραιωτῶν) was created from the Karabisianoi fleet, and assigned to the administration and defense of the southern coasts of Asia Minor. The seat of its stratēgos, first mentioned in 734, was initially at Cibyrrha and later at Attaleia. Despite the formal disbandment of the marine corps, the need for captains' and admirals' guards continued, with the prestigious rank of komēs tēs hetaireias (count of the bodyguard) being reserved for their officers. During the reign of Leo VI the Wise, records show that the navy reached 34,200 oarsmen and 8,000 marines. The central Imperial Fleet totalled some 19,600 oarsmen and 4,000 marines under the command of the droungarios of the basilikon plōimon. These four thousand marines were professional soldiers, first recruited as a corps in the mold of the former Karabisianoi by Basil I in the 870s. They were a great asset to the Imperial Fleet, for whereas previously it had depended on thematic and tagmatic soldiers for its marines, the new force provided a more reliable, better trained and immediately available force at the Emperor's disposal. The high status of these marines is illustrated by the fact that they were considered to belong to the imperial tagmata, and were organized along similar lines. The Aegean thematic fleet numbered 2,610 oarsmen and 400 marines, the Cibyrrhaeotic fleet stood at 5,710 oarsmen and 1,000 marines, the Samian fleet at 3,980 oarsmen and 600 marines, and finally, the Theme of Hellas furnished 2,300 oarsmen with a portion of its 2,000 thematic soldiers doubling as marines. After regaining Constantinople in 1261, Michael VIII initiated a great effort to lessen his dependence on auxillaries by reforming a 'national' navy, establishing a number of new corps to this purpose: the Gasmouloi (Γασμοῦλοι), who were men of mixed Greek-Latin descent living around the capital; and colonists from Laconia, called Lakōnes (Λάκωνες, 'Laconians') or Tzakōnes (Τζάκωνες), were used as marines, forming the bulk of Byzantine naval manpower in the 1260s and 1270s. Around 70 marines were stationed on each Dromon and amongst many duties they were responsible for using the siphones or Greek Fire flame thrower. On land, like most tzagratoroi (crossbowmen) they were normally used as garrisons alongside Italian mercenaries, specifically in harbour cities.

byzantine_flamethrowers	Flamethrowers	Cheirosiphōnes	The chief method of deployment of Greek fire, which set it apart from similar substances, was its projection through a tube (siphōn), for use aboard ships or in sieges. Portable projectors (cheirosiphōnes) were invented, reputedly by Emperor Leo VI. The Byzantine military manuals also mention that jars (kytrai or tzykalia) filled with Greek fire and caltrops wrapped with tow and soaked in the substance were thrown by catapults, while pivoting cranes (gerania) were employed to pour it upon enemy ships.The cheirosiphōnes were especially prescribed for use at land and in sieges, both against siege machines and against defenders on the walls, by several 10th-century military authors, and their use is depicted in the Poliorcetica of Hero of Byzantium. They first appear in the Tactica of emperor Leo VI the Wise, who claims to have invented them. Nikephoros II Phokas advised their use in field armies, with the aim of disrupting the enemy formation.

byzantine_varangian_guard	Varangians	Varangoi	The Varangian Guard appear to have taken their name from the Slavic Varjagi, which in turn comes from the Old Norse Vár 'sworn' and Gengi 'companion'. This was the name for the retinues of the early Rus Vikings as they colonised the rivers of Russia and made their way along the trade routes between the Baltic and the Black Sea. Constantinople as early as 839 were fielding Rus mercenaries that would become in time the highly trusted heavy infantry guard of the Emperor himself, preferring them over Greeks who could be bought or embroiled in dynastic politics. The Scandinavian and Russian recruits still worked in the basic Nordic fashion of warfare, but paid so handsomely as they were they kitted themselves out with the best Byzantine armour available. After the fall of the English to the Normans in 1066 many Anglo-Norse nobles fled to eastern Europe, many marrying into the Russian, Polish and Hungarian royal families. Naturally many joined the ranks of the Guard, which by virtue of this; now became known as the 'English Guard.' The Anglo-Norse style of fighting was the same as before however, and all the troops spoke mutually understandable languages. The Guard, although a Byzantine institution spread copycat bands in the employment of various eastern princes. These units were typically styled in latin as Comitatenses or Comitatus and were well-known all around the Black Sea. The 12th century Byzantine historian John Kinnamos calls them 'axe-bearers of the British nation, which has been in service to the Romans' Emperors from a long time back' remembering the Germanic Foederati troops of the Romans, but also indicating the Saxon composition of the guard well up to the point of the Fourth Crusade. Although the regiment of the Varangion was a mix of diferent troops, this unit represents the elite Imperial Guard and those select Nordic warbands that assembled around the rulers who emulated Byzantium.

In the Byzantine Empire, paroikoi were non-proprietary peasants, hereditary holders of their land, irremovable as long as they paid their rent. They were similar to European villeins.

camel_archers	Banu Hilal tribesmen	Banu Hilal	Banu Hilal were a confederation of Arabian Bedouin tribes that migrated from Upper Egypt into North Africa in the 11th century, having been sent by the Fatimids to punish the Zirids for abandoning Shiism. Other authors suggest that the tribes left the grasslands on the upper Nile because of environmental degradation accompanying the Medieval Warm Period. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring Hammadids. Their influx was a major factor in the linguistic and cultural Arabization of the Maghreb, and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.

caspian_archers	Daylami Archers	Rumat al-Daylam	The Deylamites or Dailamites were an Iranian people inhabiting the mountainous regions of northern Iran on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. They were employed as soldiers from the time of the Sassanid Empire, and long resisted the Arab conquest of Iran and subsequent Islamization. In the 930s, the Dailami Buyid dynasty emerged and managed to gain control over much of modern-day Iran, which it held until the coming of the Seljuk Turks in the mid-11th century. The Dailamites lived in the highlands of Dailam, part of the Alborz mountain range, between Gilan and Tabaristan. ollowing the Persian defeat in the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, the 4,000-strong Dailamite contingent of the Persian guard, along with other Persian units, defected to the Arab side, converting to Islam. Nevertheless, the Dailamites managed to resist the Arab invasion of their own mountainous homeland for several centuries under their own local rulers.Warfare in the region was endemic, with raids and counter-raids by both sides. Under the Arabs, the old Persian fortress-city of Qazvin continued in its Sassanid-era role as a bulwark against Dailamite raids. According to the historian al-Tabari, the Dailamites, along with the Turks, were considered the worst enemies of the Muslims. During the reign of Harun al-Rashid, several Shia fled to the Dailamites, most of whom remained pagan, with a few Zoroastrians and Christians, to escape persecution. Among these refugees were the Alids, who began the gradual conversion of the Dailamites to Shia Islam. Nevertheless, a strong Persian identity remained ingrained in the peoples of the region, along with an anti-Arab mentality. The local rulers, like the Ziyarid dynasty, made a point of celebrating old Iranian and Zoroastrian festivals.

catalan_almogavars	Roger de Flor's Catalan Company	Companyia Catalana d'Orient	A regiment formed by the Sicilian-German noble Roger von Blume, better known as Roger de Flor, in 1302, with Aragonese and Catalan mercenaries who were idle in the Kingdom of Sicily after the peace of Catalbellota. Roger was a fugitive of the Templars, and in order to avoid the Pope and his Order, he travelled to Byzantium (whose emperor, Andrónikos Palaiologos, needed military help) with his mercenaries (commanded by his friend Berenguer d'Entenza) to fight the invading Turks. The Company set sail in Messina with 36 ships and 8000 soldiers. They were received by the Basileus himself in Konstantinoúpolis in 1303, and there Roger set his conditions to the emperor: should he help him in the defence of the Empire, he would marry the niece of Andrónikos and he would gain the title of Great Duke. The Basileus accepted. The presence of the Almughavars, who represented the interests of the Crown of Aragón, upset the Genoese colony in Konstantinoúpolis, who faced the Aragonese in the city and caused a confrontation between both colonies. The Almughavars started a massacre in which 3000 Italians were killed by the mercenaries. The emperor ordered the Almughavars to depart for Anatolia as soon as possible. There they crushed the Turks in Kýzikos (1303), Germe (1304) and liberated the city of Philadelpheia, which was under Turkish siege. They settled their headquarters in Magnisía, and from there they continued their campaigns against the Turks, recovering for Byzantium an important part of Anatolia. The Byzantines however, began to see that they had created a monster- the Company were basically the new masters of Anatolia. In July the Almughavars defeated another important Turkish force at the Cilician Gates, in the frontier with Armenia, where 18,000 Turks were defeated by Roger de Flor's own forces. It was then when Magnisía, garrisoned by Alans, the enemies of the Aragonese and the other great mercenary force of the Byzantine Empire, rioted against the Almughavars. In the next months the hate of Byzantines grew against the Catalan Company, which had come to be seen as an army of insubordinate barbarians, even worse than Turks for the Empire. In 1305 the Emperor enticed DeFlor and his men to a great banquet as a pretext to assassination. Using Alan calvary, Roger de Flor was killed, and only 1400 Catalans survived. This small company, now commanded by Berenguer d'Entenza was furious at the Byzantine betrayal, and vowed vengeance. They acted as guerrilla fighters, pillaging and terrifying the Empire before finally defeating the Byzantines in pitched battle at Gallipoli in 1305. In just two years, the Company had devastated the fields of Makedonía and Tráki, fomenting absolute terror. The Company, after several major confrontantions were actually able to grasp power in Athens and Thebes, which they then ceded to the Crown of Aragón, whereupon they rejoined the ranks of their countrymen. They were in many ways the first of the condottieri, heralds of a new age in warfare, the rise of the proffessional mercenary soldier.

cathar_infantry	Cathar soldiers	Bons Chretiens	Credentes or Believers, were the ordinary followers of what became known as the Cathar or Albigensian movement, a Christian sect which flourished in western Europe during the 11th, 12th and 13th Centuries. Credentes constituted up the main part of the Cathar community in the region. Cathar 'heresy' believed in pacifism but in the persecutions, particularly during the Albigensian Crusade they forced to occupy castles and defend themselves. They referred to themselves merely as 'good christians', and although they had their heartland in Languedoc their branches sprang up all over Europe. While only conditionally militant, they often presented a serious threat to the Catholic order, and this was no doubt down to their vast numbers. They were closely related to the Bogomils, and were sometimes indistinguishable since it was outsiders who defined their religion in categorical terms. It is now generally agreed by most scholars that identifiable Catharism did not emerge until at least 1143, when the first confirmed report of a group espousing similar beliefs is reported being active at Cologne by the cleric Eberwin of Steinfeld. A landmark in the 'institutional history' of the Cathars was the Council, held in 1167 at Saint-Félix-Lauragais, attended by many local figures and also by the Bogomil papa Nicetas, the Cathar bishop of (northern) France and a leader of the Cathars of Lombardy. The Cathars were largely a homegrown, Western European/Latin Christian phenomenon, springing up in the Rhineland cities (particularly Cologne) in the mid-12th century, northern France around the same time, and particularly southern France—the Languedoc—and the northern Italian cities in the mid-late 12th century. In the Languedoc and northern Italy, the Cathars would enjoy their greatest popularity, surviving in the Languedoc, in much reduced form, up to around 1325 and in the Italian cities until the Inquisitions of the 1260s–1300s finally rooted them out. In the case of the Albigensian crusade, it was the population of Toulouse -around 30,000 people that refused to give up their native minority population of merely 3000 Cathars, this popularity is a credit to their piety and the respect they held amongs the local communities they came in contact with. It is for this reason perhaps that they endured so much persecution, given shelter by the common people. Waldensians in the latter Middle Ages were also an offshoot of the Catharian heresy 	PLACEHOLDER LIGHT INFANTRY	light infantry	Good defence, good morale, peasants	-	-	Regional Rebels	Jaca, Pamplona, Barcelona, Tolosa, Bordèu, Orléans, Ghent, Cöln, Aics, Baselia, Lyon, Raben, Ancona, Milan, Genoa, Turin, Bologna, Verona, Erphesfurt, Regensburg, Trier, Frankfurt	all	-	freemen	militia		BASE:none, UP1: gambeson, UP2: , UP3: , SHIELD: , HELMET: 	farmtool	none	pilgrims/peasants?	-	-	-	infantry	spearmen	light	English	main_spear	-	-	Levy_Spearmen	60	0	1	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	druid	sea_faring, hide_forest, can_withdraw, general_unit	 1.2, 1.2	2.4, 2.4	5	square, schiltrom	1	0	5	2	no	0	0	melee	melee_blade	piercing	spear	,	25	0.6	-	-	-	spear, spear_bonus_8	0	0	no	0	0	no	melee_simple	blunt	none	,	25	1	-	-	-	no	0	1	6	flesh	0	0	flesh	2	1	-2	3	2	2	3	normal	trained	30	0	700	500	1	310	125	75	60	310	4	70	-	0, 1, 2, 3	Levy_Spearmen	slave	slave	slave	slave	-	1

eastern_black_hoods	Black Hoods	Chernye Klobuki	Pechenegs and other Steppe peoples who mixed and lived in semi-settled harmony with the Russian states. They were of course peerless horse-archers and in many cases their clans and tribes provided them with so much status and wealth that their own equipment out-shone that of their Rus counterparts. There were lesser ranks among their number too and the sources do not differentiate between types, only ethnicity. The 'black hoods' probably has a derogatory meaning, rather than referring to an item of common clothing. They quickly adapted to life as militias, garrisons and private armies, with their abilities and skills allowing them to infiltrate all of Russia. Their military fashions influenced the Rus soldiers greatly, and their own civilian interaction helped to meld cultural contrasts between the Russo-Norse, Slavs and the eastern people with whom they had such a colourful changeable relationship with.

eastern_city_militia	Russian city militia	Opolchenie	The urban militias were very well funded for the most part, life in the provincial capitals was much more preferable to life in the open landscape due to its safety and pick of the fruits of the province. Russia was rich in horses, and even the city-dwellers were able to keep horses and ride daily. The merchant classes and craftsmen could easily be seen as gentry since wealth was variable, but it did confer rank in military terms. The opolchenie militia was a more of a reserve guard, and in many ways could be linked to the later Oprichniki of Ivan the Terrible. The opolchenie were the entourage of the tax collectors, many of whom were themselves merchants who had been made tax-exempt and therefore became a kind of magnate or lord in their own right.

eastern_horse_archers	Russian Best Men	Luchshikh muzhej	The term 'best men' or 'better men' occurs several times in the Russian Primary Chronicle as well as in the Novgorod Chronicle, both in reference to landholders, knights, boyars and elders and their class of men. In many cases they were volunteers of the their lords' but often acted as political hostages which were common in much of medieval society. Year 945 - 'So they sent their best men [luchshikh muzhej]... Olga then sent messages... that... they should send after her their distinguished men [luchshikh muzhej]... they gathered together the best men [luchshikh muzhej] who governed the land of Dereva, and sent them to her... The Derevlians inquired of Olga where the retinue [druzhina] was which they had sent to meet her... Thus she took the city and burned it, and captured the elders [starejshin] of the city... some she gave to others as slaves to her followers [muzhi].' Year 987 - 'Vladimir summoned together his boyars [boyar] and the city-elders [startsev gradskikh]... The boyars [boyare] and elders [startsy] replied...   Year 988 - 'He took the children of the best families [luchshikh liudej], and sent them for instruction...'

english_churls	Churls	Churls	The word churl derived from Anglo-Saxon meaning 'freeman', referring to a man of the Middle Classes. It has cognate forms in Scandinavian and Germanic names 'karl', 'carl' or 'charles', and 'huscarls'. By the medieval period, the importance of churls in the feudal system declined thanks to the Norman seizure of assets and land tenures.

ethiopian_cavalry	South Eastern African Warriors	Zagwe	The Zagwe dynasty ruled Ethiopia from approximately 1137 to 1270, when Yekuno Amlak defeated and killed the last Zagwe king in battle. The name of the dynasty is thought to come from the Ge'ez phrase Ze-Agaw, meaning 'of Agaw' and refer to the Agaw people. Its best-known king was Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, who is given credit for the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela. Around 960, Queen Gudit destroyed the remnants of the Aksumite Empire causing a shift in its temporal power centre that later regrouped more to the south. For 40 years she ruled over those remnants, eventually passing them on to her descendants. According to other Ethiopian traditional accounts, the last of her dynasty was overthrown by Mara Takla Haymanot in 1137. He married a daughter of the last king of Axum, Dil Na'od putting control of Ethiopia in Agaw hands.

european_buckler_men	Buckler men	Rotulari	Although, the sword and buckler is often associated with the fencing methods of the early 1500s and with the common serving man, it was a form of fighting with a much longer tradition. Sword and buckler fighting also became a “combat sport” of sorts, but not before it had already long been a martial system of self-defense and battlefield skill.  What is recognisable about the buckler is that it was foremost a military tool used in war by both soldiers and knights. In the Middle Ages, bucklers were common armaments among both knights and common soldiers – even more so than shields.  A buckler was less cumbersome and more agile than a larger shield and easier to carry about or wear on the hip.  We know that sword and buckler play was a popular pastime in northern Italy, in Germany, and in England. The earliest references to professional combat instructors or masters of defense as they were to become known all have one thing in common. They refer to schools of sword and buckler. Add to this the fact that the earliest known fechtbuch or fight book is dedicated solely to sword and buckler combat, then it becomes apparent that sword and buckler combat is arguably the oldest surviving martial tradition within Western Martial Arts today. The primary use of the buckler in Europe was by infantry. Light infantry, made up of commoners armed with bucklers and swords or falchions lined up behind troops with pole-weapons, were used frequently in armies during the 1100s to 1300s. Early Medieval pictorial sources, from c.650 to c.1100, additionally show bucklers in use by Celtic, Frankish, and Byzantine horsemen. Medievalist Donald Kagay reports of ordinances from 1363 by the Crown of Aragon’s parliament of Monzón which specified the military equipment required for frontier troops on active duty. Light mounted troops were required to have among their weapons a cuyrase (breast plate), a camisol (maile shirt), helmet, lance, and a small round leather shield called a darga de scut. Bucklers are also common in Medieval artwork depicting Middle Eastern warriors, but these small shields are actually for mounted combat and are typically held sideways by two straps as opposed to the center-held buckler with its single handle.  But the sword and buckler was most effective in foot combat such as with the Italian Rotulari (c. 1475) buckler infantry. One historian best explains their development: “It was to combat the new emphasis on field fortifications that a new type of infantry became popular in Italian armies. This was the so-called ‘sword and buckler’ infantry, first experimented with by Braccio. They were lightly armed, agile, and equipped for hand-to-hand offensive fighting. The type had already been developed in Spain in fighting with the Moors, and the establishment of Aragonese in Naples in the 1440s clearly had something to do with their appearance in Italy at this time.”	PLACEHOLDER LIGHT INFANTRY	light infantry	light small units, excellent defence and with a strong bonus against armour-heavy infantry	-	-	NE, SE, CE (byzantine mercenaries)	cultural	early, high, late	-	freemen	elite		BASE:gambeson, UP1: mail, UP2: mail/brigandine, UP3: partial plate, SHIELD: , HELMET: 	estoc	none	Frankish swordsmen	sword	-	http://www.thearma.org/Manuals/i33/i33a.jpg	infantry	spearmen	light	English	main_spear	-	-	Levy_Spearmen	60	0	1	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	none	sea_faring, hide_forest, can_withdraw, general_unit	 1.2, 1.2	2.4, 2.4	5	square, schiltrom	1	0	5	2	no	0	0	melee	melee_blade	piercing	spear	,	25	0.6	-	-	-	spear, spear_bonus_8	0	0	no	0	0	no	melee_simple	blunt	none	,	25	1	-	-	-	no	0	1	6	flesh	0	0	flesh	2	1	-2	3	2	-	3	normal	trained	30	0	1000	700	1	310	125	75	60	310	4	70	-	0, 1, 2, 3	Levy_Spearmen	northern_european, southern_european, central_european, byzantium	northern_european, southern_european, central_european, byzantium	northern_european, southern_european, central_european, byzantium	northern_european, southern_european, central_european, byzantium	-	1

finnic_warriors	Curonians	Kurši	The Curonians were known as fierce warriors, excellent sailors and pirates. They were involved in several wars and alliances with Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic Vikings. Grobin was their main center during the Vendel Age. Chapter 46 of Egils Saga describes one Viking expedition by the Vikings Thorolf and Egill Skallagrímsson in Courland. They took part with Estonians in attacking Sweden's main city Sigtuna in 1187. Curonians established temporary settlements near Riga and in overseas regions including eastern Sweden and the islands of Gotland and Bornholm, similarly Scandinavians began settling in western Baltic lands such as Lithuania and Latvia. The Curonians were an especially religious people, worshipping pagan gods and their sacred animal, the horse. Some of the most important writing sources about the Curonians are the Rimbert's Vita Ansgarii, the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia, the Livländische Reimchronik, Egils Saga, and Saxo Grammaticus's Gesta Danorum.

icelandic_mounted_archers	men not bound in service'	Lausamenn	Icelandic records speak of men who often went east and entered royal service in Norway, mentioned particularly in Brennu-Njál's Saga, and also referred to the Icelandic law code as a man contrasted to 'thrall' or serf. Lausamenn, meant literally 'loose men' those without ties to any specific House or clan. Ironically, it was precisely these men that were well-known abroad as emigré Huskarlar. On Iceland however they represented the free men of the small farmsteads which made up Iceland's communities. While the composite bow may seem an unlikely weapon for a land so remote and so far from its eastern origins, the weapon was known amongst the Vikings as the 'Hunnic bow' or 'Horn bow'. Whilst of a very simple and reduced design compared to the eastern bows, this small compact weapon was perfect for the peculiar climate of Iceland where wooden bows were sensitive to the damp weather and where tall trees were unavailable to make warbows. Several Nordic sagas refer to the use of hornbows in skirmishes across the open landscape. Konungs skuggsjá (The King's Mirror), a 13th century Norwegian training text, refers to a hornbogi (horn bow) as being a useful weapon for a mounted warrior, since it is easy to draw while on horseback. Recurve bows are seen in Brennu-Njáls saga, chapter 63, where Gunnar and his brothers Kolskeggr and Hjörtr were ambushed by Starkaðr and a much larger band of men. The brothers were able to kill fourteen of the ambushers, while on their side, only Hjörtr was killed. The small ruggid Icelandic ponies were well-known throughout Scandinavia but in Iceland were a standard and neccessary means of transport.

irish_elite_cav	Landlords	Bóairi	Flatha were traditionally the Gaelic nobility an ancient social group descended from all the royal houses. However, with the arrival of the foriegn influences of Normans, Scots and English the old system and its terminology waned in favour of 'barons'. The few 'Ri' kings left in the higher Middle Ages were naturally surrounded by a mixture of cultural and ethnic nobles. A Boaire was a 'free-holder', often a subnoble grade, or middle class. While not officially having recognition as a noble grade, and instead being the highest grade of ignoble free-men, they were treated as nobles by numerous foreigners, and many held regional sub-noble titles, such as being a chief of a lesser tribe or clan. As the Cambro-Norman culture took over Ireland, the Bóairi represented a higher echelon of the old heirarchy and in many ways the Irish nobility themselves were indistinguighable from their easterly counterparts, but in the cases of the more pastoral lords they were in all senses 'chiefs'. It was the continued rank of the lesser nobles as landowners which was one of the few continuities in medieval Ireland.

irish_heavy_inf	Gallowglasses	Gallóglaigh Corrughadh	Gallowglasses, literally 'foreign warriors', were fierce men from the Eilean Siar (Western Isles), of mixed Gaelic and Viking descent. After the defeat of the Norwegians at the Battle of Largs, the inhabitants of the contested islands descended into a petty war of succession, with various descendants of the Viking nobles or Gaelic warlords forming clans of followers. When one of these clans was defeated, they were forced to flee their homes, often looking for new work as mercenary soldiers, notably in Ireland. They were protected by a helmet, a mail coat and a breastplate. They carried a great axe or a claymore. The claymore was a relatively popular weapon for the Scots, and despite its Gaelic name 'claimheamh mòr- 'great sword', the weapon itself was probably introduced by the Vikings. But in the Scottish Early Medieval period it became increasingly useful against both heavy infantry and cavalry, its primary quality being disturbing spear formations. Originally it was a tribal weapon, fielded in small numbers by specialist shock troops, however in time, even noblemen such as William Wallace used the weapon. In the later Medieval period, the longswords and Germanic zweihänder became the weapons that were key elements of pike and musket warfare. After being organised by the Scottish national army, they were formed into Corrughadh or 'battle groups' of 100 men. They were well-paid and respected men, basically tribal sergeants who would bring with them their own small band of kerns to support them.

khazar_horse_archers	Black Khazars	Kara Qaz Ar	The Khazars' tribal structure were divided between Ak-Khazars ('White Khazars') and Kara-Khazars ('Black Khazars'). The 10th-century Muslim geographer al-Istakhri claimed that the White Khazars were strikingly handsome with reddish hair, white skin and blue eyes while the Black Khazars were swarthy verging on deep black as if they were 'some kind of Indian'. However, many Turkic nations had a similar (political, not racial) division between a 'white' ruling warrior caste and a 'black' class of commoners. George Cedrenus or Kedrenos (Greek: Γεώργιος Κεδρηνός, fl. 11th century) was the author of a Byzantine world history. His work was written either at the end of the 11th or start of the 12th century. Generally known as Compendium historiarum, or a concise history of the world, it spans the time from the Creation of the world to the accession of Isaac I Comnenus in 1057. Kedrenos documented a joint attack on the Khazar state in Kerch, ruled by Georgius Tzul, by the Byzantines and Russians in 1016. By at least the year 900 the Khazars were following the Jewish faith and had many of their customs, for instance all the Khazar rulers had Hebrew names such as Aaron, Benjamin and Joseph. In the 950s King Joseph of the Khazar nation is known to have had direct contact with the Caliphate of Cordoba in southern Spain, preserved in the documents known as the the “Khazar Correspondence”. Jewish Khazars were also mentioned in a Georgian chronicle as a group that inhabited Derbent in the late 12th century. Giovanni di Plano Carpini, a 13th century Papal legate to the court of the Mongol Khan Guyuk, gave a list of the nations the Mongols had conquered in his account. Giovanni refers to one tribe practicing the Jewish faith, the Brutahki whom he identifies as part of the Kipchak confederaion, they may have been a remnant of the Khazar state. Ibn Hawqal and al-Muqaddasi refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt. Al-Biruni (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was in ruins, and did not mention the later city of Saqsin which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century. Even assuming al-Biruni's report was not an anachronism, there is no evidence that this 'new' Atil was populated by Khazars rather than by Pechenegs or a different tribe. Ibn al-Athir, who wrote around 1200, described 'the raid of Fadhlun the Kurd against the Khazars'. Fadhlun the Kurd has been identified as al-Fadhl ibn Muhammad al-Shaddadi, who ruled Arran and other parts of Azerbaijan in the 1030s. According to the account he attacked the Khazars but had to flee when they ambushed his army and killed 10,000 of his men.

khazar_mercenaries	Muslim mercenaries in Khazaria	Arsiyah	Arsiyah, sometimes referred to as al-Arsiyya or As-yah was the name used for a group of Muslim mercenaries in the service of the Khazar Khaganate. Whether the Arsiyah were a single tribe or composed of Muslims from a number of different tribes is unclear. Also unclear is their origin; many historians regard them as deriving from Khwarazm, but some scholars point to the fact that 'As' is the Turkic term for Alans and believe that the Arsiyah were Alanic in origin. According to Muslim sources, the Arsiyah formed the core of the Khazar army and were extremely influential in Khazar politics, but these assertions may be designed to exaggerate the importance of the Muslim community in Khazaria. The Arsiyah did often act independently of their government. Part of the treaty binding them to Khazar service guaranteed that they would not be used to fight other Muslims. In 913, the Arsiyah ambushed a Viking fleet that had been granted passage to the Caspian Sea by the Khazar government, wiping out thousands of Rus warriors.

Their weregild in the Russkaia Pravda was the same as the non-service aristocracy. Precise definitions of this class are hard to come by. They seem to have been moderately well-to-do urban or rural people, with wealth based on industrial enterprises, trade, or land ownership. They had no special legal privileges. The lower classes in Kievan society were made up of diverse rural and urban elements. The weregild for these lower-class freemen was fixed at 5 grivnas. This 'price-bracket' of freemen (between 5 and 40 grivnas) were in cities, called molodshie liudi (literally, 'junior people'). They were artisans and craftsmen, often organised into guilds and associations. The term is also very well attested in both the Russian Primary Chronicle and Novgorod Chronicles. They seem to be the same as the 'Blacks' or 'Common People' who are in no way serfs but who are contrasted with the Boyars as 'chornago', 'the common people rose against the Boyars...' (cherny na boyara).

lithuanian_royal_inf	Lett Retinue Stablemen (Royal Infantry)	Leičiai	Leičiai (sg.: leitis) were a distinct social group in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They disappear altogether by the time of the Wallach Reform. The ethnonymic meaning of leičiai, e.g. 'Lithuanians', is known from several sources. The word leitis, leičiai (< *leitiai) derives from the form *leitā, a synonym of *lietuvā, *leitavā, which had the meaning of armed retinue, bodyguard, attendant soldiery, troop, which is shown by numerous writings, for example Russian sources: krestil knjazja Litovskago imenem Evnutija i ego družinu Litvu – 'baptized the duke of Lithuania Jaunutis and his retinue Lithuania'; I pšišed posol Totui i vydal Korjadą i ego družinu Litvu knjazju velikomu Semenu Ivanovičiu – 'and came an envoy Totui and handed Karijotas and his retinue Lithuania over for Grand Duke Semyon Ivanovich'. According to S Karaliūnas, leičiai were also stablemen, caring for warhorses more as grooms than squires, which were an important martial property. As a social group leičiai were mentioned in the sources of the 15th and the first half of the 16th century. They were the possession of a monarch, that is, subordinates to a state, not personally to nobles. The first such mention of them is known from 1407, when Vytautas granted an estate, among which staff leytey are mentioned, for Manvydas, then an elder of Vilnius. The monarchs Alexander Jagiellon and Sigismund I the Old used to transfer their estates to nobles for a temporary administration, receiving cash, which was needed for a war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The documentation of such contracts is the major source of leičiai' mentions. They were mentioned among service staff in various estates. Leičiai were warlike servants of a ruler, the staff enforcing his authority. Their duties were likely related with warfare, among which possibly were growing of riding horses, providing roadmen, protection of the frontiers. One leitis from Eišiškės volost, in a litigation against a minor land owner over his patrimonial plot in 1514, said that he was an eternal leitis (лейти звечный). In Western Europe we might compare them to local marshalls, sherriffs, sergeants or royal guard grooms.

muscovian_gunners	Muscovy Gunners	Pushki	A brilliant sample of Russian guns of the 15th century is the bronze pishchal cast by Russian master Jacob in 1491. It is the only dated monument of Russian bronze cannon founding of the 15th century which has survived to the present day. Since the late Muscovian medieval era the word pushkar (i. e. gunner) may be found in Russian chronicles. It shows that people specially trained for firing guns appeared in the Russian army at that time. According to Russian chronicles, the explosive characteristics of powder had already been known in Rus by the time of the Kulikovskaia battle. The earliest mention of combat using Russian artillery dates from 1382. Muscovites used tiufiaks and 'great guns' during the defence of Moscow from troops of Khan Tokhtamysh in September of that year. Three general types of arms had been used in the Russian artillery by the early 15th century. These are cannons, intended for plunging fire, pishchals for flat trajectory firing with balls and tiufiaks for short­range firing with drob. Considerable changes took place in artillery of the 15th century. These connect first of all with new technology of making guns and powder. In the middle of the century iron forging was replaced with casting guns from bronze, an alloy of copper and tin which made the production process much easier and quicker. In addition sighting systems appeared in the form of front and back sights that were intended for visual homing guidance of the gun on a target.

muslim_general_companions	General's companions	Mawla ashab	Mawali or mawālá (Arabic: موالي‎) is a term in Classical Arabic used to address non-Arab Muslims. The term gained prominence in the centuries following the early Arab Muslim conquests in the 7th century, as many non-Arabs such as Persians, Egyptians, and Turks converted to Islam. These converts were treated as second class citizens by the ruling Arab elite - they continued to pay the tax required of nonbelievers and were excluded from government and the military until the end of the Umayyad Caliphate. Therefore, many of them were drawn to the anti-Ummayyad activities of the Kaysanites Shia. Under the Abbasid rulers of the 9th century, the mawālī comprised an important part of the army. The fragmentation of the Abbasid around 900 took place with the mawālī rise to power, the Saffarid Dynasty and Ghaznavids in Greater Iran, and the Qarmatians in the Arabian Peninsula. Together, the rise to power of these ethnic groups restricted the power of the Abbasid caliph into Baghdad.

ne_urban_militia	Urban militia	Burghers	The word burghers is cognate in a number of Germanic language, such as the Nordic 'borgare' and French 'bourgeoise.' The word borg, bourg or English placenames 'bury' and 'burgh' all mean a walled fortified town. The term burgher therefore came to mean the civilised middle class that were contrasted to the rural peasants typically portrayed as uncultured and backward- an idea that remains even today. Burghers were naturally capable of bearing arms as much as any man. Most burghers were well-off freemen that would carry a sword and dagger even walking down the street. In times of war they would form 'trained bands' of garrisons and wall-defenders.

nomad_turkish_cav	Nomad Turks	Yörük	During the Ottoman period Turkic nomads were known by the names of Türkmen and Yörük or Yürük (Türkic 'Nomad', other phonetic variations include Iirk, Iyierk, Hiirk, Hirkan, Hircanae, Hyrkan, Hyrcanae, the last four known from the Greek annals). These names were generally used to describe their nomadic way of life, rather than their ethnic origin. However, these terms were often used interchangeably by foreigners. At the same time, various other exoethnonym words were used for these nomads, such as 'Konar-göçer', 'Göçebe', 'Göçer-yörük', 'Göçerler', and 'Göçer-evliler'. The most common one among these was 'Konar-göçer' - nomadic Turcoman Turks. All of these words are found in Ottoman archival documents and carry only the meaning of 'nomad'. There are tribes in the Balkans and Turkey today that still lead nomadic lives as shepherds, and they too carry the name Yörük.

norwegian_retainers	gift-receivers	Heiðþegar	Sigvatr Þórðarson (also known as Sigvat the Skald), a court poet to two kings of Norway, Olaf II of Norway (saint Olaf) and Magnus the Good (and also to two kings of Denmark), called the retainers of Olaf II of Norway heiðþegar, meaning 'gift- (or pay-) receivers'. More precisely, Snorri Sturluson explained that 'heið-money is the name of the wages or gift which chieftains give'. Thus, Sigvat probably referred to an institution similar to the Danish heimþegar or to the housecarls of Canute the Great: free men in the service of a king or lord, who gave them gifts as payment of said service. From a military perspective they were fairly effective in the early era as a form of home guard or royal men-at-arms, but as with all Norwegian military developments they failed to change with the times and became quickly outdated and irrelevant to pre-Renaissance warfare.

pecheneg_light_cav	Pechenegs 	Becsenek	Pechenegs,  a latin chronicle in Hungary used the name "Beseneu" for them. The adoption of the P in Persian, Latin & German chronicles is due to a misunderstanding caused by the Greeks. The oldest recorded form in Greek chronicles are the following: Bisseni, Bessi, Pecinati, Pincennates. The name by the way comes from the Turkic word bajanaq or bajinaq meaning "Brothers-in-law", which probably referred to the alliance of the tribes.

persian_heavy_arbalesters	Heavy Arbalests	Kaman Charkh	Windlass crossbows or arbelests, very common but notably heavier than their European counterparts. Crossbowmen caught by the enemy not only had their thumbs cut off but also had their weapons hung around their necks as torture. Typically their bolts weighed half a kilogram and had a range of 900 metres. The Arabs called it Jarkh, and the Turks Carh, they saw widespread use in the 12th and 13th centuries where Zangi specifically suffered heavy casualties thanks to units armed with this devastating weapon.

prussian_heavy_cav	Ordenstaat Sergeants	Rossdienst	It is calculated that around the year 1400 there were 13,887 horses in the castles, on the breeding farms and on the estates of the Teutonic Order in Prussia, of which only 7,200 belonged to the breed of large military horse. In addition there were the war- and saddle-horses of the brethren of the Order, which have been estimated to have been 2,250 in number. Thus one can assume that the Order was in possession of around 16,000 horses at this time. The large horses were bred not only by the Teutonic Order, but also in the four bishoprics and on the estates of the German and Danish nobles who were under an obligation to perform military service. Those who possessed more than 40 hides of land (1,680 acres) served with heavy armour on a covered horse (dextrarius opertus or textus) which had to be a stallion and with at least two further horsemen as escorts (Rossdienst). Those with 10 to 40 hides had to perform one or more services with 'plate' or other light weapons (Platendienst).  Plates were made in the form of a 'poncho' consisting of rows of vertically or horizontally arranged iron plates riveted to leather or thick cloth. The horse was sterilized or castrated (a spado). With the increasing importance of the crossbow as a long-range weapon, armour became heavier and the plate service developed into service on a war-horse which was three to four times as expensive as a Sweik. Rossdienst and Platendienst were clearly lesser landowners and direct entourage of the larger landowners, since the latter equate to barons the former we can relate to sergeants -especially in regard to their feudal duties, equipment and land ownership. Generally, Teutonic military strategy had developed a reliance on short sharp shocks and raids (Stossreisen, Ruckreisen), these presented a constant threat to the natives and allowed a good source of income. Campaigns had to be planned so that as far as possible the army was self-supporting in enemy territory. It is not surprising, therefore, that they were carried out only in summer when fodder was available in the meadows and there was grain in the fields, or in autumn, when enemy stores could be plundered. This was the case in 1409, 1410, 1414, 1422 and 1431 as well as during the Thirteen Years' War of 1454-66.  That the infantrymen still played no important role in the conduct of the war (except in the case of sieges) was not only a consequence of the superiority of the cavalry, but also because, in contrast with the horsemen, they could carry only limited provisions with them. Mounted troops were quicker, more mobile and could stand their ground longer in the field.

prussian_light_cav	Prussian auxillary horsemen	Briesweiken	During the conquest of Prussia, the Knights became familiar with a small horse indigenous to that region, the so-called Sweik (Schweike). This designation probably derives from a Baltic word meaning 'healthy' or 'strong'. These animals had a stocky, muscular build and generally measured at the withers not much more than ten hands. In a letter of 1427 the Teutonic Order grand marshal called them 'little shaggy horses' ('cleyne gerugete pherde'). The Sweiks were swift, tenacious and hardy. They served the native Prussians and other peoples of the Baltic as saddle- and workhorses as well as war-horses. In the last case, however, it was only possible for the rider to be lightly armed with 'the native Prussian weapons' of spear, shield (scutum Prutenicum), mail/lamellar armour (Brünne) and the Prussian helmet (a specific variety of the conical helmet) and this is to be contrasted with the western style cavalry using heavy armour, even armoured barding for the horses. Although the Sweiks, because of their limited size, were not used by the Christian conquerors as cavalry horses for themselves, they were bred systematically by the Order. For the Knights' courier service the so-called Postal-Sweiks (Briesweiken) were indispensable. However, they were not bred by the Order itself, but purchased from native Prussians which indicates they had a certain local or elite nature. When, after a hard struggle, the Prussians had been defeated by the Teutonic Order in the thirteenth century, the native nobles had to perform military service for the Knights against the Lithuanians and later also against the Poles, as light auxiliary troops (Equites Pruteni -'Prussian Knights').  Like the Turcopoles in the Holy Land, they fought with their native weapons, with which they were familiar, 'according to the custom of the country', and thus we can assume that the Sweiks were employed as war-horses. The basis of such native Prussian service was the possession of a small farm, often no more than one or two hides of land, as the expense of horse and equipment was not very great. Around 1400, a good German warhorse cost 12 to 15 marks and a very good one 15 to 18 marks, whereas a Sweik could be had for 3 to 6 marks. Much greater sums were paid for excellent chargers - even sums as high as 70 marks. This corroborates the information we have from elsewhere in Europe, but the Sweik was a truly cost-effective rarity.

scandinavian_longbowmen	Scandinavian Longbowmen	Langbuen	Longbows were known in the north since Viking times, however the weapon never really had the same effect it did in English armies. Bows were made from yew, ash, or elm. Typically, they were 1.6 to 2m (60 to 80 in) long. A complete bow found at Hedeby made of yew was 192cm long. In fact, Scandinavia was one of the main exporters of wood for English longbows. The Vikings and early English called it the 'warbow', possibly because smaller hunting bows didn't have the punch to pierce armour. Grágás, the medieval Icelandic law book, requires that the court empowered to confiscate an outlaw's property be held within bowshot of the outlaw's home, Grágás defines the bowshot to be two hundred faðmar (about 480m). The so-called Hunnic Bow (Húnbogi) was also known in the north, probably through contact with the Rus in the east, or possibly through actual historical contact with the Huns. It was made of horn and quite compact but it was only a very basic inspiration from the composite bow, and used mainly by nobles on horseback. Again however, the longbow seems to have been the standard for warfare: After Einarr Þambarskelfir's bow was broken at the Battle at Svölðr in 1000AD, the king threw him his own bow, telling Einar to continue shooting. Einar fitted an arrow and drew it back but, unaccustomed to the lesser draw-weight of the king's light bow, he famously shouted. 'Too weak, too weak is the king's bow!' Which was taken as a herald of King Olaf Tryggvason's defeat.

It was typical throughout the Viking Age and early Middle Ages that these men would wander far afield and seek service as a standing army, they were equipped by their masters and would wear their heraldrics. Many of them were the type known amongst the Byzantines as the dispossessed and desparate cutthroats, they would fight and risk death if not as loyal servants then as ambitious men keen on gaining rank and spoils. As standard troops they would be typically dressed in gambeson, some mail with upgrades, a spear and shield, helmet and shortsword.

scottish_archers	Men of the hills	Bunadh na Gcnoc	An account of the 15th century siege of Roxburgh mentions Scottish Islesmen fighting 'in the old Highland manner' with 'axe, bow and haubergeon'. They were also referred to in more classical texts with the Latin or rather Greek gloss of 'Psiloi' which meant literally “bare, stripped” (referring to skirmishers) and recalls the early medieval reports of Gaelic troops fighting 'naked'. Most historians take 'naked' to mean a military sense- of being unarmoured. Whilst it is true that going barefoot was common practice even for fairly wealthy Gaels, the use of gambeson and mail was actually quite widespread even from the 1100s, a far cry from blue-painted men in tartans. In fact, the Highlanders were very much influenced by their Norse forebears, and it is possible that this is where the use of the warbow originates. However, their clothing -like most Gaels even those in Ireland- was the ubiquitous 'leine', a saffron or horse-urine stained (in poorer cases) tunic which fastened at the hip with a belt, where a dagger or traditional 'dirk' would be carried.

scottish_armsmen	National Armsmen	Servitum Scoticanum	Military service was required from freeholders, just as in the feudal systems of other nations. As Scotland became more structured and centralised, the organisation of social classes into warfaring units became clearer. Men began to accept their loyalties to the crown, especially during the wars with England. These men are similar to sergeants, but are still attached to the clan system, nonetheless they lead their own contingents and are well-armed.

scottish_elite_pikemen	Elite Scottish Pikemen	Sceldtrome	The term dates from at least 1000 AD and derives from Old English roots expressing the idea of a 'shield-troop'. Some researchers have also posited this etymological relation may show the schiltron is directly descended from the Anglo-Saxon shield wall, and still others give evidence 'schiltron' is a name derived from a Viking circular formation (generally no less than a thousand fighters) in extremely close formation, intended to present an enemy's cavalry charge with an 'infinite' obstacle (that is, a perimeter horses refuse to breach). Matters are confused by the fact that the term in Middle English could clearly refer to a body of soldiers without reference to formation, including cavalry and archers. The first mention of the schiltron as a specific formation of spearmen appears to be at the Battle of Falkirk in 1297. There is, however, no reason to believe this is the first time such a formation was used and, indeed, may have had a long previous history in Scotland, as the Picts used to employ spears in block formation as the backbone of their armies. There are two recorded Scottish instances of circular schiltrons: William Wallace's army at Falkirk (1298), and Thomas Randolph's forces on the first day of Bannockburn (1314). The circular formation is essentially static. At Falkirk, the formation was fortified by driving stakes into the ground before the men, with ropes between. Charles Oman describes the formation thus: 'The front ranks knelt with their spear butts fixed in the earth; the rear ranks leveled their lances over their comrades heads;the thick-set grove of twelve foot spears was far too dense for the cavalry to penetrate.' There are numerous accounts of rectilinear schiltrons — they were employed at the battles of Glen Trool (1307), Bannockburn (the main battle), Myton (1319), Dupplin Muir (1332), Culblean (1335), Halidon Hill (1333), Neville's Cross (1346) and Otterburn (1388). Unlike the circular schiltron, the rectilinear formation was capable of both defensive and offensive action. The offensive use of the schiltron is a tactical development credited to Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn. He had drilled his troops in the offensive use of the pike (requiring great discipline) and he was able to fight the English forces on flat, firm ground suitable for their large force of cavalry. Bruce's new tactic was a response to a crushing defeat for the Scots at Falkirk when the first recorded use of the schiltron by a Scottish army failed in the face of a combination of English archers and cavalry. Detailed descriptions of the formation are rare but those given by English chroniclers of Bannockburn demonstrate the essential features: 'They had axes at their sides and lances in their hands.They advanced like a thick-set hedge and such a phalanx could not easily be broken.' 'They were all on foot; picked men they were, enthusiastic, armed with keen axes, and other weapons, and with their shields closely locked in front of them, they formed an impenetrable phalanx ...' The term schiltron is also used by Barbour to describe English infantry at Bannockburn. It is also used by the author of the Lanercost Chronicle to describe the English spearmen at the Battle of Boroughbridge (1322). In both cases, a rectalinear formation is being described, though that at Boroughbridge is curved, with its flanks bent back. Schiltron-like formations were also used by the Welsh troops at the battles of Orewin Bridge (1282) and Maes Moydog (1295), although this tactic was generally unsuccessful for the Welsh, arguably due to the lack of superior drill and training required to create an effective formation. Working as a cohesive formation was not widespread military doctrine until the late Middle Ages, and the innovation of the Scots was not the weapon itself but their approach to its use.

sicilian_retinue	Sicilian Armed following	Comitiva	These were a precursor to the Condottieri of the north, they were basically private armies employed by smaller landowners and lesser nobles to protect their personal assets and local territories. They could also be seen as the spearhead of urban militias and levies in the defence of a city. It is likely that their mercenary qualities arose from the troubled and changeable governments of Sicily, responding to each invading aristocracy from the Byzantines, Saracens, Normans, Aragonese, Germans and French. In this way, local armies were much more common than an allegiance to a national army.

sudanese_cavalry	Sudanese Arabs	Banu Kanz	The Banu Kanz (Arabic 'Sons of Kanz') were a group of Rabi'ah Arabs who emigrated to Egypt, eventually dislocating the Beja and penetrating into the desert east of the Nile around Aswan. During the period, the gold mines of the region briefly made a resurgence. In 1004 the Caliph al-Hakim bestowed the title of Kanz ad-Dawla upon the leader of the tribe for their capturing of the fugitive Abu Rakwa. In 1066, the Kanz ad-Dawla Nasir invaded Nobadia but was repulsed and had his lands raided instead. Still, the family became an important power in the region, gaining control of the Aswan region and achieving nominal independence before being defeated by the Ayyubids under Shams ad-Dawla Turanshah, Saladin's brother, in AD 1173.

swedish_gunners	Swedish hand cannons	Bössor	Bössor were an attempt made by the Swedish monarchy to assert their grasp on modern warfare and equipment. The gunpowder technology was a veritable arms race that was encouraging all nations to out-do the other in quality and quantity. Sweden's answer to this problem was the bössa, a weapon which most other countries used as a light artillery unit mounted on ships or fortifications, or even vehicles. This was, to all intents and purposes a heavy weapon, its rather formidable power and expense meant that only highly trained specialists were entrusted to operate them.

swedish_royal_cav	Swedish royal police	Fogdhemænn	The Fogde was the Crown's means of enforcing taxes and tithes, overseeing feudal systems such as scutage and seeing that knights carried out their feudal military services. These men were a form of henchmen, they would act on behalf of the king as custodians, bringing otherwise unruly nobles to heel. They would act as armed escorts to prisoners such as rebel lords, and form a contingent around a loyalist 'judex' or judge that was sent into the outlands or provinces to perform justice.

They were well-placed to fight for the Empire, the Italian States and for the English, Burgundians or French in France itself. Vorhut applies to a spearhead unit, for which the mercenaries were often used.

table_cannon	Table Cannon	Pot-de-fer	The pot-de-fer was first depicted in a manuscript, De officiis regum of 1326, by Walter de Millimete, an illuminated manuscript of 1327 that was presented to Edward III upon his accession to the English throne. The manuscript shows a large vase lying on a table, with an armored man behind it holding a rudimentary linstock near the bottom (in this case the linstock would have held a red-hot wire, heated in a brazier, rather than a slow match). A bolt, called a garrot, protrudes from the muzzle. Although illustrated in the treatise, no explanation or description was given. The pot-de-fer was used by the French in the Hundred Years' War in a raid on Southampton and in battles in Périgord, Cambrai, and Quesnoy. They may also have been used against the Scottish by the English. An early reference to the name in French is as pot de fer a traire garros (an iron jug for throwing arrows). Such a 'pot de fer' had a bottle shape, which may have suggested its name.

teutonic_knights	Teutonic order Confratres	Consanguinei domus Theutonicorum	Layknights of the Teutonic order, also called Confratres although this definition was not always clear nor was the term 'Halbbrüder'. However, knights that had come to support (even at times literally save the Ordenstaat) men particularly from German states and Bohemia saw themselves not as full brothers of the Order, but as 'relatives' or Consanguinei- literally 'same blood'. These men were formally pilgrims but in reality were just nobles that had attached themselves to the Order's forces as a form of penance or more cynically, to elevate their own status. Typically they only served for short campaigns, perhaps no more than a year. Most Orders particularly those in Spain or the Holy Land that were more stationary, had layknights attached to the Chapter Houses as Donati- who would literally donate and financially support the local monks, even working on their lands with them. For the Teutonic Order things were different whilst on the Northern Crusades, whilst it was relatively easy to acquire such men -some political wrangling was often required by the Order, and a few bribes to kickstart the call to arms in the homelands. However, in the field, these men lived off the Order and didn't help on the Order's estates to pay their way. Indeed, they were designed primarily as a sort of short-term military contractor. As such they couldn't be kept on the lists for long, but since the Order knights themselves were fairly limited these conscripted crusaders were very useful in adding bulk to the Order's forces. The Northern Crusades attracted adventurers from as far afield as Scotland and Hungary but not always of knightly stock, in fact many were merely sergeants. On top of that, they did not fight as an organised team nor did they possess a great deal of motivation for their cause- nonetheless they were the more common 'half-brother' blood in the body of the Order.

teutonic_sergeant_crossbowmen	Teutonic Order Sergeants	Sariantbrüder 	Brother-Sergeants were also known as Graumäntler or grey-cloaks due to their grey surcoats and the added distinction of the half-cross or Tau. Like most military Orders, originally there was little distinction in class between knigts and sergeants, if at all. However as medieval society began to deepen the rift between the class and elevate the chivalric nobles- sergeants became second class. Termed 'Andere Brüder' or 'secondary brothers' they were not given as much statuis as the knights, nonetheless the reality was that they were much more numerous than the knights, and were the true backbone of the Ordenstaat army. The crossbow is constantly recurrent in the Order sources as a stable weapon of the troops used in massive numbers.	PLACEHOLDER ARCHER UNIT	archers	monastic lesser noble foot knights	-	-	HRE.

turcoman_horse_archers	Turcomans	Türkmân	The Turkomen also known as Oghuz Turks (a linguistic term designating the Western Turkic or Oghuz languages from the Oghur languages) were a historical Turkic tribal confederation in Central Asia during the early medieval Turkic expansion. The name Oghuz is just the Common Turkic word for 'tribe'. They are referred to as 'Western Turks' because they moved west from other Turkic peoples after the Göktürk empire collapsed, and because the majority of the areas in which they inhabit today (except Turkmenistan and the Turkmen Sahra) are west of the Caspian Sea, while those referred to as 'Eastern Turks' live east of the Caspian Sea. The founders of the Ottoman Empire were also Oghuz Turks. In the 9th century, the Oghuz Turks from the Aral steppes drove the Pecheneg Turks of the Emba region and the River Ural toward the west. In the 10th century they inhabited the steppe of the rivers Sari-su, Turgai, and Emba to the north of Lake Balkhash of modern day Kazakhstan. A clan of this nation, the Seljuks, embraced Islam and in the 11th century entered Persia, where they founded the Great Seljuk Empire. Similarly, in the 11th century a Tengriist Oghuz clan—referred to as Uzes or Torks in the Russian chronicles—overthrew Pecheneg supremacy in the Russian steppe. Harried by another Turkic horde, the Kipchaks—a branch of the Kimaks of the middle Irtysh or of the Ob—these Oghuz penetrated as far as the lower Danube, crossed it and invaded the Balkans, where they were either crushed or struck down by an outbreak of plague, causing the survivors either to flee or to join the Byzantine imperial forces as mercenaries (1065). Those Uzes or Torks who settled along the Russian frontier were gradually Slavicized though they also played a leading role as cavalry in twelfth and early thirteenth century Russian armies where they were known as "Black Hoods".... Oghuz warriors served in almost all Islamic armies of the Middle East from the eleventh century onwards, in Byzantium from the ninth century, and even in Spain and Morocco. They founded several dynasties and provided the core for several empires including the Seljuks, White Sheep Turcomans, Black Sheep Turcomans, Afsharids, Ottomans, Qajars, and Artuqids. In the Crusades, turcopoles, turcoples, turcopoli or turcopoliers (from the Greek: Τουρκόπουλοι, 'sons of Turks') were locally recruited mounted archers employed by the Christian states of the Eastern Mediterranean. The crusaders first encountered turcopoles in the Byzantine army during the First Crusade. These auxiliaries were the children of mixed Greek and Turkish parentage, and were at least nominally Christian although some may have been practising Muslims.

turkish_horse_archers	Borderland Turks	Etrâk-i Uc	Etrâk is a word found in many Middle Eastern sources not least in the later Turkish Ottoman period as a reference to their own kind. Historically, all of the Western or Oghuz Turks have been called Türkmen or Turkoman. The word Etrâk was most well-known referring to the warrior units called Uci. Uc means border in Turkic, and were literally men of the borderlands, they joined the campaigns under the command of Amirs, and proved their worth as hardened soldiers, fast and excellent cavalry as a rule, all Turks were horse archers, with mixed equipment but always with the standard silk armour and recurved bow.

venetian_elite_militia	Elite Venetian Militia	Guardia della Quarantia	Though Venice was famous for its navy, its army was equally effective. In the 13th century, most Italian city states were already hiring mercenaries, but Venetian troops were still recruited from the lagoon, augmented by cavalry auxillaries from Dalmatia such as the famous Schiavoni. The register of 1338 estimated that 30,000 Venetian men were capable of bearing arms; many of these were skilled crossbowmen, amongst these however were elite guardsmen that protected the Republic government, even from itself, due to the common conspiracies between rival mercantile families. The Quarantia was the Supreme Tribunal office also known as the the Council of the Forty, formerly established in 1179. Its main purpose was a form of senate, although more keyed to maintaining rigid legal controls on all citizens. The office was naturally not immune to corruption or infiltration by the signoria families, however as an ideal it was a bastion of the government. The Guardia were the city police, responsible for high level militia duties, guarding the banks and the important members of state.

venetian_marines	Oltremarini 	Oltremarini 	Though Venice was famous for its navy, its army was equally effective. In the 13th century, most Italian city states already were hiring mercenaries, but Venetian troops were still recruited from the lagoon, plus feudal levies from Dalmatia (the very famous Schiavoni or Oltremarini) and Istria. The Fanti da mar was the marine corps of the Republic. Their creation is traced back to the time of the Fourth Crusade when the Doge Enrico Dandolo ordered constituted a regiment of ten companies, variously deployed on ships. This body took part in the subsequent Siege of Constantinople (1203-1204). They wore a red jacket, blue shirt and pants, trendy ungara, black cap with bow and boots. In times of emergency, all males between seventeen and sixty years were registered and their weapons were surveyed, with those called to actually fight being organized into companies of twelve. The register of 1338 estimated that 30,000 Venetian men were capable of bearing arms; many of these were skilled crossbowmen. As in other Italian cities, aristocrats and other wealthy men were cavalrymen while the city's conscripts fought as infantry. By 1450, more than 3,000 Venetian merchant ships were in operation. Most of these could be converted when necessary into either warships or transports. The government required each merchant ship to carry a specified number of weapons (mostly crossbows and javelins) and armour; merchant passengers were also expected to be armed and to fight when necessary. A reserve of some 25 (later 100) war-galleys was maintained in the Arsenal. Galley slaves did not exist in medieval Venice, the oarsmen coming from the city itself or from its possessions, especially Dalmatia. Those from the city were chosen by lot from each parish, their families being supported by the remainder of the parish while the rowers were away. Debtors generally worked off their obligations rowing the galleys. Rowing skills were encouraged through races and regattas.

Venetian_selectees	Cernide	Cernide	The cernide or cernida (also known as the cranide in Dalmatia) were territorial armies of the Veneto and Istria that annually received some military training. The name cernida derives from the fact that the one or two young men were chosen (cerniti, or Italian for selections) for every ten from among the young men resident in these areas. These units could thus be mobilized quickly, unlike the army, which was slower to recruit and slower moving. They were formed of soldiers on annual service, with an obligation to gather for brief training periods four times a year, and accounted in total for about 30,000 men.

victual_brother_pirates	Victual Brothers pirates	Vitaliener	The Victual Brothers were a multinational freebooter guild, they were at first hired by the Dukes of Mecklenburg and the Hanseatic League to harass Danish shipping, especially when Albrecht of Mecklenburg came to the throne of Sweden. In 1393 they sacked the town of Bergen for the first time in its history and in 1394 they conquered Malmö. All along the Rostock coast they held harbours and outposts, even holding ground in Frisia and Finland. In 1395 Queen Margaret of Denmark ascended the Swedish throne and unified Scandinavia under the Kalmar Union, she hired Richard II’s English navy to fight back the Victuals and in 1398 she invited the Teutonic Order to invade and purge the entire island, ending the guild for good and opening Wisby, their main base up to the machinations of the Hansa.

scottish_chief_cav	warlike chiefs	Bellatores Capitalis	Clan chiefs would usually only fight leading their clans. But with the emergence of national army organisation and the regulating of levies, militias and feudal service, especially under Norman rule- the crown required a system of military recruitment based on social classes, land ownership, and local authority. In this way, local lords could be called up from an entire district in a similar fashion to the English draft of the 'hundred' where a champion from each hundred people (usually the village 'headman') would be equipped by his neighbourhood. In this way the chiefs formed a band of good, solid soldiers. The only drawback to this system was that it totally overlooked clan politics and rivalries, the Norman lords- ignorant of such complexities, failed to realise that this could undermine discipline and organisation in such a competitive assembly of warriors.

persian_vigilantes	Vigilantes	ʿAyyārān	The ʿayyārān have often been confused with the ḡāzīs and fetyān. This is incorrect but explicable. The ḡāzīs, being volunteers for holy war, were only important in frontier regions, at first mainly in Central Asia where they faced the pagan Turks. Although they were recruited from town-dwellers and concentrated in towns, they had no links with the urban social organisations. Conversely the ʿayyārān had nothing to do with holy war. In the frontier regions, however, the two elements were obviously bound to become more or less intermixed, whereas in the towns on the Iranian plateau no such process occurred. There can be little doubt as to their pre-Islamic origin, not only because in later times they were said to have certain distinctively Iranian customs, but above all because in the Islamic period up to the Mongol invasion they were only to be found in territories which had once belonged to the Sassanian Empire. Ayyarun fought for Islam in Asia, though most of the writing about them centres on their Baghdad activities of the 10th to the 12th centuries. Baghdad was ruled by the Buyids (945–1055), and was a very lawless city, caused by fighting between Sunnis and Shi'ites. They did many terrible things such as extorting taxes on roads and markets, burning wealthy quarters and markets, and looting the homes of the rich by night. For several years (1028–33), Al-Burjumi and Ibn al-Mawsili, leaders of the 'ayyarun, ruled the city due to governmental instability. The 'ayyarun have been commonly called thieves and robbers, though these activities are highlighted during times of weak government and civil war, when their role as a military force most likely made them fight on multiple sides, angering many. During times of more stable government, their unlawful activities decreased, and when the Seljuqs ruled in the 12th century, their activities almost ceased. The 'ayyarun also made war against much of society in reaction to social injustices. Outside of Baghdad, the 'ayyarun were closely allied with the middle class, and helped maintain the current order. The Saffarids (861-1003) of eastern Iran were in fact an 'ayyarun dynasty. They are thought by some historians to have contributed to the weakening of Baghdad, clearing the way for the horrific destruction of the city by the Mongols. The term kāka and its cognate kākagi are common words in Afghan Persian (or Dari) and are roughly equivalent to the well-known Persian words, ʿayyār (q.v.) and ʿayyāri, and javānmard and javānmardi. The word kāka is not to be confused with kākā, though the two likely have the same root. In Afghan Persian kākā means “paternal uncle” but is also used as an honorific, reflecting the idea of “sir.” Similarly, terms such as bibi kuku, an honorific for a woman of respect, or lālā ku, an honorific for a respected master, reflect the notion of someone who is considered to be of superior status than others. Although the word ʿayyār means a vagabond or vigilante, the actual social group were characterized by the ideals of chivalry, courage, generosity, and loyalty.

sunni_light_cav	Sunni Youth Guilds	Fityán	Futuwwa (Arabic: فتوة, 'young-manliness' or 'chivalry') is a Sufi term that has some similarities to chivalry and virtue. It was also a name of ethical urban organisations or 'guilds' in medieval Muslim realms that emphasised honesty, peacefulness, gentleness, generosity, avoidance of complaint and hospitality in life. According to Ibn Battuta, a member was called fata (youth, pl. fityan) and group leaders were called akhi. Warriors of the Faith were warbands or warrior guilds. Some were just glorified bands of brigands. In 12th century in Damascus, Ibn Jubayr wrote of an organisation called the Nubuya that fought Shi'a Muslims in Syria. The Abbasid Caliph an-Nasir (1158–1225) approved of and supported futuwwa. In 1182 he organised a warrior futuwwa order that was for all practical purposes a knightly order with mounted warriors. He became the head of this order and gathered ruling princes and other notables to its membership. It continued for some time after the death of its founder. This military futuwa was also practiced by Javans, mercenary soldiers of 10th and 11th centuries in Khurasan, Persia (although they may have also had non-Muslim soldiers amongst them). Apparently it may have been a model for janissaries.

turkish_archers	Religious volunteers	Mutavvi'a	Ghāzī warriors depended upon plunder for their livelihood, and were prone to brigandage and sedition in times of peace. The corporations into which they organised themselves attracted adventurers, zealots and religious and political dissidents of all ethnicities. In time, though, soldiers of Turkic ethnicity predominated, mirroring the acquisition of Mamluks, Turkic slaves in the Mamluk retinues and guard corps of the caliphs and emirs and in the ranks of the ghazi corporation, some of whom would ultimately rise to military and later political dominance in various Muslim states. In the west, Turkic ghāzīs made continual incursions along the Byzantine frontier zone, finding in the akritai (akritoi) their Greek and Armenian counterparts. After the Battle of Manzikert these incursions intensified, and the region's people would see the ghāzī corporations coalesce into semi-chivalric fraternities, with the white cap and the club as their emblems. The height of the organisations would come during the Mongol conquest when many of them fled from Persia and Turkistan into Anatolia. As organisations, the ghazi corporations were fluid, reflecting their popular character, and individual ghāzī warriors would jump between them depending upon the prestige and success of a particular emir, rather like the mercenary bands around western condottiere. It was from these Anatolian territories conquered during the ghazw that the Ottoman Empire emerged, and in its legendary traditions it is said that its founder, Osman I, came forward as a ghāzī thanks to the inspiration of Shaikh Ede Bali. In later periods of Islamic history the honorific title of ghāzī was assumed by those Muslim rulers who showed conspicuous success in extending the domains of Islam, and eventually the honorific became exclusive to them, much as the Roman title imperator became the exclusive property of the supreme ruler of the Roman state and his family. The Ottomans were probably the first to adopt this practice, and in any case the institution of ghazw reaches back to the beginnings of their state.

moorish_black_guards	Silent Ones, Black Guards	Da'ira al-Kurs	Permanent palace guard, mainly blacks. Known as the 'silent ones' since they knew no Arabic. Interestingly, even the blacks in this era experienced especial racial prejudice against them. There are no references to any prominent black commanders, yet there are for Christians, Jews, and Saqaliba Slavs in the Moorish regiments. Unlike the Slavic slaves that were considered to have abandoned their tribal backgrounds, most blacks appear to have been very insular and unwilling, or discouraged, from adapting and integrating. Nonetheless and perhaps because of this, they were regarded with reverence and fear.

saharan_cavalry	Mande Cavalry	Borindilaalu 	Light cavalry of the Mande city states. At the start of the first millennium AD, a number of clans of the Soninké people, the oldest branch of the Mandé people, came together under the leadership of a man named Dinga Cisse. Located midway between the desert, the main source of salt, and the gold fields of the upper Senegal River to the south, it was well placed to take advantage of trade with the surrounding cities, and also with the north by a coastal route leading to Morocco via Sidjilmasa. Ghanaian society included large pastoral and agricultural communities. Its commercial class, however, was most prosperous.

The Mandé merchants of Ghâna came to dominate the luxury trade and slave trade via Saharan trade routes connecting their great cities on the southern edge of the Sahara to the northern coast of Africa. The Ghanese would enslave neighboring Africans, either to sell them or to use them for domestic purposes; those who were not sold were usually assimilated into the Mandé community. Leather goods, ivory, salt, gold, and copper were also sold in exchange for various finished goods.

shia_militia	Ishmaili Militia	Malahida Hashishiyya	The Ismailis are a branch of Shia Islam, in the Middle Ages they were stigmatised by Sunni and Christian alike often as Malahide (or mulhidun) by their enemies -meaning heretic or deviant. Much less frequently, the Ismailis of Syria were called by another abusive term, as Hashishiyya, ie, users of hashish. A branch of these Malahide heretics formed a brotherhood that would evolve into the Hashashin assassin league. Surrounded by the Abbasids and other hostile powers, and low in numbers, Hassan-Al-Sabbah derived a way to attack the Ismāʿīlī's enemies with minimal losses. Using the method of assassination (the English word is derived from Hashishiyya), he ordered the murders of Sunni scholars and politicians whom he felt threatened the Ismāʿīlīs. Knives and daggers were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed onto the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message that they were marked for death. When an assassination was actually carried out, the Hashasheen would not be allowed to run away, but rather to strike further fear into the enemy, they would stand near the victim without showing any emotion, and departed only when the body was discovered. This further increased the ruthless reputation of the Hashasheen throughout Sunni-controlled lands. Hashishiyya was an Arabic term to refer to a specific order of Nizari Ismailis, particularly those of Persia that existed from around 1092 to 1265. Posing a strong military threat to Sunni Saljuq authority within the Persian territories, the Nizari Ismailis captured and inhabited many mountain fortresses under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah, the founder of the assassin league. Surrounding these strongholds and so-called hide-outs were a steadfast militia culled from the Ismaili community which was co-dependent with the local order. Seeking refuge in the Persian mountains, particularly Hyrcania, these soldiers had much in common with their neighbours the similarly despised but also highly feared pagan Dailamites.

great_company_crossbowmen	Werner von Urslingen's Great Company	La Grande Compagnia	Werner was a Swabian member of the ducal family of Urslingen, and a descendant of the dukes of Spoleto. His name was Italianicised to Guarnieri d'Urslingen, or merely 'the Duke' Duca Guarnieri. He began his military career in 1338 fighting for Venice against the della Scala family ruling Verona. Afterwards he joined the Compagnia di San Giorgio, financed by the Veronese and led by a member of the Visconti family. After taking part in the Battle of Parabiago he formed his own company in 1342 employed by Pisa against Florence under the Malatesta family. His experience as a soldier paid off, and his company became quickly famed as the Great Company. During their early days they sacked Tuscany, Umbria and Romagna. Werner also supported Ordelaffi against the Papacy, then fought for Bologna against Modena and then switched sides to the Este family and sacked several cities including Correggio. He became feared as the ultimate Condittiero, his motto was 'Enemy of God, Enemy of Piety, Enemy of Pity' which he had inscribed on his breastplate. At one point, Luigi of Taranto hired him to defend Capua, Aversa and the south for 100,000 florins. Typically he fielded about 6,000 men-at-arms and 2,000 crossbowmen of German, Pisan and Catalan backgrounds. He fought in Germany as well as Italy and in 1347 captured Naples for Louis I the Great, king of Hungary and Poland. After numerous victories and conquests his men were struck by the plague, ambushed by the Voivoda of Transylvania, Stephen Laczkfy and defeated. Werner bounced back with an army of 3,000 Hungarian, German and Neapolitan knights and 2,000 Lombard infantry. In 1350 he was hired to capture Bologna for the exiled leader of the city Giacomo Pepoli, he sacked the city, handed it over to Pepoli and then besieged it again for ransom. He returned to Swabia, where he died in 1354 at which point the leadership of the Great Company passed to Fra' Moriale and the legend lived on.

They boasted 1000 cavalry and were made up mostly of Burgundians, however they suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Orso Orsini, where Montefeltro himself was captured and ransomed. The Company withered during this period before finding service in Perugia, finally they fought successful campaigns against Florence, Siena and even the Papal States meeting even the Company of St.George on the field.

white_company_archers	John Hawkwood's 'White Company'	La Compagnia degli Inglesi 	The Englishman John Hawkwood's company grew out of the German Albert Sterz's White Company during 1361 to 1365 in Italy. Although Sterz's company included mainly Germans and Hungarians, Hawkwood known as 'Giovanni Acuto' to the Italians, quickly gathered English immigrant mercenaries to him. Many were like himself experienced survivors of the Hundred Years War, they become so numerous that they easily lended him their support. John Hawkwood first gained command of the Company in 1365 by election. Sterz's company basically split off from the English and they found themselves more than capable of independent 'work' so themselves broke from the White Company. The new English unit contained large numbers of infantry, particularly English longbowmen. These could be mounted on horses as were the 600 involved in the Battle of Castagnaro in 1387. When Pope Gregory XI's war against Milan ended in 1375, many Florentines feared that the pope would turn his military attention toward Tuscany; thus, Florence paid off Gregory XI's main military commander, John Hawkwood, with 130,000 florins, extracted from local clergy, bishops, abbots, monasteries, and ecclesiastical institutions, by an eight-member committee appointed by the Signoria of Florence, the otto dei preti. Hawkwood also received a 600 florin annual salary for the next five years and a lifetime annual pension of 1,200 florins.

scottish_foot_nobles	Gentlemen	Daoine Uaisle	These men were noted among the Anglo-Irish contingents of nobles such as the Butlers in the 1400s. Along with Gallowglass and Kerns they formed a third class- the more conventionally armed 'gentlemen' retinues recruited from the relations of the nobles themselves. It is notable that despite having distinct Norman heritage, these upper-class warriors still had a Gaelic soubriquet, like their more provincial compatriots. This infers that they were perhaps part of an older tradition within the clan system. The English and Scots speakers referred to them as 'Tacksmen' for, being related by birth to the Chief, these men controlled areas or 'tacks' within the greater clan lands. Rents were collected in various forms and rents from the daoine uaisle which were in turn paid to the Chief, Laird or Lord. Later they were given a more stylised name as 'cadets' of the noble houses.

cl_foot_knights	Company of the Carroccio	Squadra della Morte	The Company of Death is the name of a temporary military association organised and equipped by a leader known as Alberto da Giussano. It had a great importance during the Battle of Legnano (29 May 1176) where it defended the Carroccio of the Lombard League against the imperial army of Frederick I Barbarossa. The company was assembled in haste, depriving the Lombard infantry of the valuable support of enough heavy cavalry, 'horse' were recruited by Alberto da Giussano around Brescia, and in other eastern areas of Lombardy that had contributed less in infantry and trails to the League. They were very probably particularly cruel and fierce 'professional, or semi-professional, fighters', apt at wreaking havoc in the enemy ranks. According to Milanese chronicler Galvano Fiamma it was composed of 900 men at arms but other sources and modern scholars reduce that number to 300 or, more probably, 500. According to tradition they wore a sort of dark suit (black and gray, cut vertically) connected at the sides, to cover the armour, with probably the symbol of the skull on the traditional small pointed wooden shields. Their motto or battle cry could have been, accordingly to poorly documented but reliable sources, 'Ambroeus!' The Company of Death comprised two related chosen tactical corps, entrusted to guarantee the cohesiveness and efficiency in battle of both the Milanese and Lombard League's militias through their bound by oath to the defence of the Milanese Carroccio, the wagon on which the standard of the Lombard allies stood. They fought in the Battle of Legnano (29 May 1176) against the imperial army of Frederick I Barbarossa Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, in his 5th Italian Campaign, and were determinant in his decisive defeat.

aubrac_knights	Knights of the Order of Aubrac	Chevaliers d'Aubrac	The Order of Aubrac was a hospitaller and military order founded, with its headquarters at Aubrac in the Diocese of Rodez, in the mid-twelfth century. The Augustinian rule was approved for the order by the bishop in 1162. Its original purpose was to safeguard the local hospital for pilgrims on the Way of Saint James to Compostela and on their way to Rome. Though never large, the Knights Hospitaller failed in several attempts to annex it and it remained independent and operational until the French Revolution, when it disappeared. The monastery and hospital (Hôtel-Dieu) that served as the Order's headquarters was called the Dômerie d'Aubrac. It was founded in 1031 by Adalard, Viscount of Flanders, who was beset by brigands while passing through the County of Rouergue on his way to Compostela. This makes it possibly older than the Hospital order of St John, but being a very localised force they were hardly comparable. Eventually it was attended by a collection of priests, knights, lay brothers, ladies, and lay sisters. Satellite hospitals, called "commanderies", were established at Bozouls, Milhau, Nazac, and Rodez.

st_mary_foot_knights	Knights of Saint Mary	Militiae Mariae Gloriosae	The little known Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Italian: Frati della Beata Gloriosa Vergine Maria; Latin: Ordo Militiae Mariae Gloriosae), also called the Order of Saint Mary of the Tower or the Order of the Knights of the Mother of God, commonly the Knights of Saint Mary, was a military order founded in 1261 when it received its rule from Pope Urban IV, who expressly states the purpose of the organisation and the rights and obligations of its members: [The members of the order] are to be allowed to bear arms for the defence of the catholic faith and ecclesiastical freedom, when specifically required to do so by the Roman church. For subduing civil discords they may carry only defensive weapons, provided they have the permission of the diocesan. The rule of the order was based on that of the Augustinians, but by a precedent set by the Order of Santiago and the Militia of Jesus Christ, members could marry and did not live in communal poverty. Their chief task appears to have been the pacification of the Lombard cities, racked by factional strife. In this they were largely unsuccessful, due in no small part to their political allegiance to the Church.The order gained a reputation for carelessness with respect to their vows and were labelled the fratres gaudentes (Latin) or frati (cavalieri) gaudenti (Italian): jovial/joyous/jubliant brothers/brethren/friars.The order also admitted female members as militissa. The order was eventually suppressed by Pope Sixtus V in 1558.

norwegian_wooden_infantry	Birch legs	Birkebeinar	A faction of political dissidents that rose to power during the Norwegian Civil War between 1130 and 1240. They were so 'rural' that they used wooden armour, hence the name 'birch legs'. Although originally a pejorative term, the birkebeiner adopted the name for themselves and continued using it even after they came to power at court in 1184. They were based in Trondhjem and were made up of lawndowners that had been dispossesed, marginalised or disinherited by the kings based around Viken and Bergen, in an attempt to threaten and undermine the power of the county of Trondhjem. Progressing from mere raiders and rebels they quickly acquired support from princes who had a claim to the crown, such as Erling Skakke and Sverre Sigurdsson who in fact himself became king in time. Under such leadership they developed into a more hardened and serious body of fighting men, gaining recruits from as far afield as England.

war_ballista	War Ballista	Qaws al-ziyar	Used by Saladin in his assault on Acre, it was also known amongst the Moors. Disassembled 4 could be carried on a single cart. Assembled, it took 11 mules to either move or to power the machines, which infers it was mainly comprised of poles and ropes. It probably used a frame system of scaffolds (al Tarsusi records it as being over 16 ft high) and used a torsion skein engine to fire stones or bolts. The two-armed bow version of the weapon was highly-regarded, firing explosives from mixed silk and horsehair strings, it had a crew of 20 men. The head of the bolt itself weighed 2 KGs although there are no records of the actual bolt weight itself, which seems to infer that it was the 'warhead' of the bolt which was important. Al Zaradkash in his 'An elegant book on mangonels' called the weapon a 'kuskanjil'. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor is even known to have acquired one. al Tarsusi, Saladin's military technical advisor described the machine as for being used against 'the greatest towers and any obstacle, for none can withstand it'. The engineering principle behind the weapon was known in Europe as the espringald, it seems to have been very ineffective in its execution however which is why it defaulted to or was confused with the common ballista/field crossbow. Nonetheless the ziyar itself was the main inspiration to Da Vinci for his 'Great Crossbow.' A possible variant of this was the so-called 'ox bow' or Kaman-i gav. Mongols are documented as fighting in India and Iran using this formidable siege weapon which probably had Chinese engineers operating it. It fired incendiary missiles at a distance of 2,500 metres and was used successfully against castles unsurprisingly.

burgundian_knights	Knights	Bas chevaliers	Simply French for 'low knights' -that is of low nobility, perhaps in rank of sergeants but related to the ducal houses by blood. These lesser knights were known throughout Europe and not least by this very name in western Europe. However in Burgundy as the state emerged into a more distinct and independent autonomy- the Burgundian Bas Chevaliers made up a fearsome core of the Burgundian warmachine, an aggressive well-trained cavalry which in fact was far ahead of its time in terms of professional tactics. Despite the reputation that medieval knights were themselves the perfect warriors of the age, in the high medieval era they were far from it. Whilst undoubtedly when committed to an attack they were generally a table-turner, for the most part knights were totally removed from the actual strategic outcomes but maintained an opportunistic focus on the opposing aristocrats in an attempt to defeat them mano et mano and claim their prizes in ransoms amongst other material things.  What the Burgundian cavalry did was to rely on a large-scale heavy cavalry that was not made up of an uncontrollable arrogant elite, but instead a dedicated force that served the overall military instincts of the state. In this respect they paved the way for the massive Napoleonic era cavalry regiments of central Europe. Despite the Renaissance's reliance on pike and musket the rise of the dedicated lancer companies as seen in the French and Burgundian model of the late middle ages maintained the essential cavalry role on European battlefields for centuries.

crescent_light_cav	Order of the Crescent (unique unit)	Ordre du Croissant 	The Ordre du Croissant (Order of the Crescent; Italian - Ordine della Luna Crescente) was a chivalric order founded by Charles I of Naples and Sicily in 1268. It was revived in 1448 or 1464 by René I, king of Jerusalem, Sicily and Aragon (including parts of Provence), to provide him with a rival to the English Order of the Garter. René was one of the champions of the medieval system of chivalry and knighthood, and this new order was (like its English rival) neo-Arthurian in character. Its insignia consisted of a golden crescent moon engraved in grey with the word LOZ, with a chain of 3 gold loops above the crescent. On René's death, the Order lapsed.

cypriot_men_at_arms	Cypriot Men-of-War	Gens de Guerre	Led by a royal Chevataine captain and assembled into 'reglement', these companies were the backbone of the French-led Catholic 'new lords' of the Kingdom of Cyprus. They were welcomed by the Armenian people as the saviours and defenders of their own kingdom, under acceptance of foreign rule, to defend them as Christians from the Muslim. However in order to do this, they had to sacrifice much of their own Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism. Since Cyprus' capture during the Third Crusade in the twelfth century, and receiving predominantly Frankish refugees from the Fall of Acre in 1291- the population of Cyprus was very influenced by the French, long before the Lusignans. Of course, there were also the other nationalities of marooned Europeans, Byzantines and Armenians, who had made a life for themselves hoping for a return to the Levant to reclaim past glories. Culturally they continued the fashions of the Eurocentric Syrian militaries under the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

danish_men_at_arms	Kings household men-at-arms	Hirdembedsmænd	An institution from the Viking age Hird, embedsmænd were the closest men to the king- a kind of developed huskarlar. They were responsible for maintaining order in the kingdom, collecting taxes and generally representing royal authority even over stubborn nobles. The office was also known as an entitled royal court administrator, similar to a chancellor, but the actual force also remained. The term is used in modern countries across the world as the Ombudsman. It means literally 'to carry forth' or bear a message, and they were primarily heralds and enforcers of the king's will.

eastern knights	Russian Knights	Boyarstvo	The word boyar may have developed from the Bulgar or Turkic word for lord. To all intents and purposes they were the knights of Russia, and varied in powers much the same as their western counterparts. The noble council, boiarskaia duma, developed out of the princely retinue of warrior chieftains (druzhina), whose leading members became boyars with estates and commercial interests. As they acquired extensive hereditary lands, the boyars grew more independent - more independent of the prince than the chieftains of the ancient princely retinue were. Boyars directed special branches of goverment. As feudal landlords, they were vassals of the knyaz, obliged to serve in his army, but possessing the right to leave to a new suzerain and were fully sovereign in their own patrimony and had their own vassals.

eastern_druzhina_cav	Russian Retainers	Druzhina	An armed retinue in ancient Rus' that served the prince and formed the main military force. In peacetime, the members were in charge of local districts and in war, formed the core of the army. They were closely associated with the prince, receiving full support/provision from him in addition to influential administrative posts. They counseled the prince, and participated in diplomatic negotiations. The druzhina was divided into two groups: the senior druzhina, or muzhi knazhiie, composed mainly of boyars who performed higher state functions; and the junior druzhina, or hryd (aka grid), who were responsible for the personal protection of the prince and carried out a variety of commissions for him in the royal court and provincial administration. In the 11th-12th centuries, the druzhina and the old landed nobility (zemski boyars) united to form a single aristratic class. In the chronicles, the word druzhina is sometimes applied more widely - to refer to the national militia, the entire princely army, or smaller military troops.

The word 'Grid' seems to come from the Norse word 'Hyrd' which referred to the Housecarl guards of the nobility.

english_yeomen_cav	Yeomen	Yeomen	The word yeoman comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'geoguth' or 'youth'. It referred originally to the 'second sons' of noble families who had good backgrounds but were not heirs to estates, and so sought their fortunes in war. In the medieval period, yeomen had an enduring place in the feudal system despite being undermined by the new Norman masters. One reason for this might be due to the fact that they did not hold any real status to begin with to be undermined by the Normans that had reduced the English nobility to sergeants and local chieftains. In time, the yeoman became a class unto themselves, a kind of esquire -from Latin 'scutarius' in the sense of shield bearer- an unofficial title of respect, having no precise significance, used to denote a high but indeterminate social status. By Tudor times and thereafter the term yeoman referred to trusted royal household troops such as bodyguards.

flemish_crossbowmen	Flemish Sergeant Crossbowmen	Coningstavelryen	A town militia was subdivided into several 'vouden' or folds. Such a 'voud' or fold counts about 600 men and was composed of both patricians and craftsmen- those living within the town walls who also owned a strip of land in town, and those who belonged to a particular trade union. The patricians provided a number of men per town district in proportion to the respective number of people living in each of the districts. Each fold had a number of 'coningstavelryen' or constabularies which was each made up of about 20 serjeants, 6 horses and 2 wagons. Such a unit was commanded by a 'coningstavel' or constable. The town council payed for the horses and wagons, but the common serjeant would hardly receive a penny. At the battle of Courtrai, the number of infantrymen supplied by the town of Bruges is estimated to have been about 3.000. They were armed almost exclusively with the crossbow. In 1302, Bruges disposes of a contingent of sixteen constabularies, each having around 20 crossbowmen, 10 servants and 2 supply wagons. The town had a force totalling 320 crossbows supported by 160 servants carrying the pavises and ammunitions. The crossbowmen formed the elite of the communal army and a member of the elite Saint-George Guild was paid a wage of 4/- per day, an amount very similar to the daily pay of a squire.

khazar_heavy_cav	White Khazars	Ak Qaz Ar	The Khazars' tribal structure were divided between Ak-Khazars ('White Khazars') and Kara-Khazars ('Black Khazars'). The 10th-century Muslim geographer al-Istakhri claimed that the White Khazars were strikingly handsome with reddish hair, white skin and blue eyes while the Black Khazars were swarthy verging on deep black as if they were 'some kind of Indian'. However, many Turkic nations had a similar (political, not racial) division between a 'white' ruling warrior caste and a 'black' class of commoners. George Cedrenus or Kedrenos (Greek: Γεώργιος Κεδρηνός, fl. 11th century) was the author of a Byzantine world history. His work was written either at the end of the 11th or start of the 12th century. Generally known as Compendium historiarum, or a concise history of the world, it spans the time from the Creation of the world to the accession of Isaac I Comnenus in 1057. Kedrenos documented a joint attack on the Khazar state in Kerch, ruled by Georgius Tzul, by the Byzantines and Russians in 1016. By at least the year 900 the Khazars were following the Jewish faith and had many of their customs, for instance all the Khazar rulers had Hebrew names such as Aaron, Benjamin and Joseph. In the 950s King Joseph of the Khazar nation is known to have had direct contact with the Caliphate of Cordoba in southern Spain, preserved in the documents known as the the “Khazar Correspondence”. Jewish Khazars were also mentioned in a Georgian chronicle as a group that inhabited Derbent in the late 12th century. Giovanni di Plano Carpini, a 13th century Papal legate to the court of the Mongol Khan Guyuk, gave a list of the nations the Mongols had conquered in his account. Giovanni refers to one tribe practicing the Jewish faith, the Brutahki whom he identifies as part of the Kipchak confederaion, they may have been a remnant of the Khazar state. Ibn Hawqal and al-Muqaddasi refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt. Al-Biruni (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was in ruins, and did not mention the later city of Saqsin which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century. Even assuming al-Biruni's report was not an anachronism, there is no evidence that this 'new' Atil was populated by Khazars rather than by Pechenegs or a different tribe. Ibn al-Athir, who wrote around 1200, described 'the raid of Fadhlun the Kurd against the Khazars'. Fadhlun the Kurd has been identified as al-Fadhl ibn Muhammad al-Shaddadi, who ruled Arran and other parts of Azerbaijan in the 1030s. According to the account he attacked the Khazars but had to flee when they ambushed his army and killed 10,000 of his men.

kiev_lesser_boyars	Late lesser boyars	Deti boyarskie 	A class of minor nobles that emerged in Rus in the 15th cent. They performed obligatory service, receiving for it pomest'e (service estates) from the prince, boyar or church, but they did not have the right to leave/move. The deti boyarskie were decendents of junior members of the princely druzhina, the otroki. With the development of the Russian state in the late medieval period, a large number of deti boyarskie transferred their service to the grand prince. 'Deti boyarskie' stood above dvoryan, since the latter often came from unfree princely servants from the appanage times. They were eventually members of collateral branches of boyar families, and immigrants from principalities outside of the major capitals, people who had advanced through long service to the sovereign. The royal court of the mid-15th century consisted of princes (old families of the house of Riurik but long out of contention for the throne), the old  boyars clans, as finally the deti boyarskie.

lily_heavy_inf	Order of the Lily (unique unit)	Ordre du Lys	In the 1420s, The Earls of Buchan, Douglas, Murray and Mar had led some 6,000 Scottish Knights and Men-at-Arms to France to help the King of France against the English. They participated at the siege of Orleans alongside Rene d’Anjou and Joan of Arc. In 1424 at the bloody battle of Verneuil large numbers of the Scots contingent were killed including Sir John Stewart, the Earls of Buchan, Douglas, Murray & Mar and Sir William Seton. Sir John de Montgomery, the only remaining commander drew off the remaining Scots in good order in a fighting rearguard action. In 1425 Charles VII of France created an elite bodyguard of Scots. However there were still a great number of Scots gentlemen who could not be accommodated in the Scots guards and this group formed themselves into what amounted to an independent company called ‘Compagnie des gentilhommes Ecossais’ and wore a Fleur de Lys on their left breast to show that they owed allegiance to the King of France. It was formed from five individual companies of roughly 50 men each, including guisarmes and bowmen. This contingent helped Rene d’Anjou to regain the Kingdom of Naples and for this, were granted recognition in the form of a Document by Rene in which Rene used the term ‘Ordre du Lys’. The Order’s badge now became a cross fleury outlined in gold or yellow with a fleur de lys at its centre. In 1445 John de Montgomery was killed and Rene appointed Francisco Sforza, to be the Commander of the remainder of the Compagnie, who at that time were acting as mercenaries for Sforza, now Duke of Milan with money provided by Cosimo de Medici. In 1444 members of the Order and the Company, had fought in what today we call Bosnia-Herzegovina, but which at that time was part of the Serbian Byzantine Empire and which was in the forefront of the fight against Islam. The Order succeeded in returning George Brankovich to the throne of Serbia and this event is still marked today by the Fleur-de-Lys Monument (Called the Fleur-de-Lys Obelisk) at Blatsha. The knights followed Janos Hunyadi, Regent of Hungary (Rene was Titular King of Hungary), against Sultan Murad II where they were massacred in the 2nd Battle of Kosovo.

lithuanian_knights	Lithuanian 'Knights'	Kavalerija	As a result of the confrontation with the technically superior methods of warfare of the Teutonic Order, a reorganisation of Lithuanin military tactics became necessary. This development should be dated to the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth centuries. It included, among other things, the development of a cavalry with large horses and thus necessarily also the establishment of stud farms. Scattered reports of these are found in the chronicles of the Order. We know that around 1367 the Lithuanian prince Kestutis had a stud farm with fifty mares in Kaunas and there are also reports of a stud farm at another location. As many as 400 horses were kept in one stud farm in Zemaitija around 1379. It is to be assumed that the Lithuanians obtained breeding material for their large horses primarily during war and plundering campaigns into Prussia, as they did in 1376 at Insterburg when they attacked one of the Order's stud farms which had fifty mares, two stallions and sixty warhorses and foals, and seized these. In the course of the fourteenth century the 'non-Christians' became increasingly powerful opponents which the Teutonic Order had to take seriously, as the knightly culture of western and central Europe was no longer unknown to them. It is not without reason that in an anonymous address composed in 1415 for the Council of Constance (presumably, however, not delivered) the Order complained that 'the non-believers of whom one is at present speaking now appear powerful everywhere, with shining armour, with warhorses [geroesse] and other military equipment'. The author of this document knew what he was talking about, as five years previously the Order had suffered a devastating defeat at Tannenberg (in Polish known as Grunwald and in Lithuanian as Zalgiris) on 15 July 1410, by a joint Polish and Lithuanian army.

navarrese_heavy_cav	Luis de Beaumont-le-Roger Navarrese Company	Compañía de Luis de Navarra	The Navarrese Company was formed by Carlos el Malo of Navarra to fight against the French king during the war in Normandy and Auvergne in 1365. After the peace of 1366 the Company was organized by Luis de Beaumont-le-Roger, brother of the king Carlos, who was married with Joanna of Durazzo. Because of this marriage, Luis had the title 'Duke of Durazzo', but this town was in power of the Albanian troops of Charles Thopia. In order to regain the power in his Dukedom, Luis prepared an expedition to reconquer Durazzo, with his Company of Navarrese and Gascon soldiers. In 1375 they left Tortosa, in Aragón, and in 1376 they restablished the Regnum Albaniae conquering Durazzo again. Luis died this year, and the Company passed to the command of Juan de Urtubia. In 1378 they entered Morea, and destroyed the Catalan Company in Greece.

saharan_nobles	Mande Nobles	Horonu	Nobles of the Ghana and Malian Empires. By the tenth century, Ghâna was an immensely rich and prosperous empire, stretching across Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania. The ruler was acclaimed as the 'richest king in the world because of his gold' by Arab traveler Ibn Hawqal on his visit to the capital city of Kumbi Saleh in 950 AD. In the eleventh century, the kingdom began to weaken and decline. There were numerous reasons as to why. The King lost his trading monopoly, a devastating drought damaged the cattle and cultivation industries, the clans were fractured, the vassal states were rebelling, and, according to Arab tradition, it is said that Almoravid Muslims came from the North and invaded Ghâna. Other interpretations are that the Almoravid influence was gradual and did not involve any form of military takeover. In any event, following their subsequent withdrawal, new gold fields were mined further south and new trade routes were opening further east. Just as it appeared that Ghâna would reemerge, it became the target of attacks by the Susu (another Mandé people) and their leader Sumanguru. From this conflict in 1235 came the Malinké people under a new dynamic ruler, Sundiata Kéita. By the mid-thirteenth century, the once great empire of Ghâna had utterly disintegrated and soon became eclipsed by the Mali Empire of Sundiata.

These men would be the Hird retinue or Housecarls seated directly around the king or lord.These men were the high ranking nobles that would be commonly visited by the mobile court of the king and high Jarls, and would be themselves the hosts to their masters. They were magnates that could threaten the monarchy if they were not kept close to the crown, many were heirs and lords themselves. Wealthy and well-trained they were the best warriors in the kingdom.

scandinavian_knights	Knights	Hersar	Lords and knights- northern nobles differentiated themselves from their southern counterparts by a use of the overhand spear, often a javelin, and closed with a mace. They often wore Russian-style scale armour and lamellar, and skullcaps with chainmail aventails. Naturally they wore the heraldrics of their noble houses. By the High era they had become more alike their southern counterparts using heavy lances in a couched position and plate armour.

swedish_merchant_cav	Swedish Merchant Colonists	Birkarlar	Birkarlar were semi-Swedish merchants who dominated the cultural developments and colonisation of northern Sweden from around 1300 onwards. Despite the north lacking any real feudal system, since they were no lordships and the subjects were Sami (Lapplander) nomads, the only real 'nobility' was hard cash and trade. Sweden saw the oppurtunities for good trade in the far north once Norrland had begun to stabilise. Contacts with the north were dealt a heavy blow when the Black Death hit Scandinavia through Hansa ships from England. The ghostly arrival of ships in Jutland, Denmark and Bergen where the crew were already all dead were a chilling harbinger of the devastation that was to follow. The colonisation of provinces such as Jämtland, Medelpad, Ångermanland and Härjedalen were hardest hit and the ruins of fairly newly developed villages, townships and agricultural communities would lie in ruins for hundreds of years until they were once again re-populated. Simply put, by the end of the 1300s they were not enough people in the entire country to support the economy. This was much the case as elsewhere in Europe. However the relative long-distance trade route from the Swedish capital region around Uppland to the far north mean that a taxes and more importantly a lack of tightfisted nobles meant that Sweden had an excellent resource network it could take advantage of without military or political risks.In the Lagmansting in Piteå in 1424 the lagman Nils Gustafsson (of the Rossviksätten) presided over a legal dispute between several groups of birkarlar. In the Thing document that followed the birkarlarna are referred to as lappefara (Lapp-journeymen), and 'allom Bircherlom' -'all those Birchermen'. It was also stipulated in law that merchants or these Birkarlar 'nobles' could not exact more trade commodity from the Lapps than they themselves could support in their own communities. The point was that Swedish law was very conscious of the fact that trade from the Lapps had to be in continual flow, and could not be allowed to be decimated by overuse riffua eller slitta af the fattiga Lappa'. The Birkarlar fulfilled a function as a lifeline between the north and the central government in lower Sweden, they were active between the Norwegians, the Novgorodians and were well-established even in Finland. The Portuguese Damianus a Goës who visited Sweden in the 1500s called the Birkarlar 'nobles in the north'. Their main commodities were meat, pelts, furs, hides and possibly hunting birds- all of which were extremely valuable once they reached mainland Europe or Britain, usually via the Hansa.

sword_of_cyprus_foot_knights	Order of the sword of Cyprus foot knights	Chevaliers de l'ordre souverain de chypre	Generally assumed to have been founded by Pierre de Poitiers-Antioch de Lusignan in 1347 the order may in fact have been an earlier small branch, possibly of the Templars or Hospitallers. Under Lusignan who was at that stage only the titular Count of Tripoli the order was set up with a view to being the inner guard for the Kingdom of Cyprus and specifically rallying Latins to the Lusignan claim on the Holy Land. The idea seems to have been inspired by the Royal French 'Dauphinois Order of St. Catherine' (founded ca. 1335). When Pierre received the throne of Cyprus in 1359 he wasted no time for a full-scale Passagium Generale against Jerusalem and the other territories of the old Kingdom. Venice in particular supported his cause, offering 60,000 florins for which price ignoble merchants bought themselves into Pierre's noble order.

venetian_noble_archers	Venetian Noble Marines	Signori Marini	By 1303, crossbow practice had become compulsory in the city of Venica, with citizens training in groups. As weapons became more expensive and complex to operate, professional soldiers were assigned to help work merchant sailing ships and as rowers in galleys. The company of 'Noble Bowmen' was recruited in the later 14th century from among the younger aristocracy and served aboard both war-galleys and as armed merchantmen, with the privilege of sharing the captain's cabin.

zoroastrian_missile_cav	Zoroastrian Champions	Asawaran	Azadan nobility was first formed in Parthian times, and was carried over into the Sassanid state, where they were a force to be reckoned with. They accompanied the king in the wars and displayed great courage and discipline. They are clearly the forerunners and founders of the 'Knights' of later Arab history. The Aztan (Azadan, آزادان, 'freemen') jealously guarded their status as descendants of the ancient Aryan conquerors and rulers of the mass of originally non-Aryan peasantry far beyond the borders of Iran. These Azatan formed a numerous minor aristocracy of lower-ranking administrators, mostly living on their small estates and providing the cavalry backbone of Sassanid army. Most prestigious among them were the armoured 'Aswaran' اسوران who normally decided the outcome of a battle. Despite their downfall in the 7th century AD, the legacy of the Savaran endured in Europe, the Caucasus, India and the Muslim world. It was the elite cavalry of Sassanid Persia, who were the forerunners of the later Arabian Faris, the English knights, the Caucasian horsemen, the Indian Suwar (derived from Persian Savar), and the Turkish Tarkhans. In point of fact, certain of the later Muslim heavy cavalry, such as the non-Steppe Mamluks, were possibly the descendants of the clibanarii cavalry, as they used similar weapons and tactics. The amount of money involved in maintaining a warrior of the Asawaran (Azatan) knightly caste required a small estate, and the Asawaran knightly caste received that from the throne, and in return, were the throne's most notable defenders in time of war. As Persian nobles under Turkish rule they were officially Sunni by religion but were still tightly bound to their Zoroastrian traditions, elements of this old Persian nobility could be found across the old domains of Persia and into Armenia.

norwegian_noble_infantry	Bishops' Men	Baglerne	The Bagli Party or Norwegian: Baglerne, was a faction or party during the Norwegian Civil Wars. The Bagler faction was made up principally of the Norwegian aristocracy, clergy and merchants. It was formed in Skåne, then part of Denmark, in 1196 principally by Bishop Nicholas Arnesson of Oslo and Archbishop Erik Ivarsson of Nidaros around the pretender Inge Magnusson (nicknamed the Baglar-King) to depose King Sverre Sigurdsson. It contested with the Birkebeiners, essentially a faction of peasants, led by the pretender King Sverre, for control in a Norwegian civil war during the late 12th century. Sverris Saga provided Sverre a royal lineage as putative bastard son of the late king Sigurd II of Norway, which in the Norway of the time provided him a claim to the throne. Bagler comes from the word bagall, from Church-Latin's baculum, referring to a Bishop's Crosier. It was mainly the Church establishment, particularly the Archbishopric of Lund which was the main ecclesiarchal political centre for the North, that interfered in the political crises.

sicilian_upstart_nobles	Sicilian Estate managers	Gabelloti	Due to the relative turmoil in Sicily between the various invaders: Saracen, Byzantine, Norman, Genoan, Aragonese- the actual ownership of small but wealthy estates were forever changing hands and each new class of landed gentry would take time to be accepted into the feudal system as true barons. As such they were often looked down upon by feudal knights as provincials but they were keen to carve their place in society.

zoroastrian_knights	Zoroastrian Knights	Dihqánán	The word dihqanan was often used to differentiate the old Zoroastrian Persian elite, from the azadan who were the noble cavalry (asbaran), the term was applied to the village lords (dihqanan) as knights, but also to refer to priestly and learned tiers of society. The dihqanan are cited in numerous sources as opponents of the Arab Muslim incursions on Persian society, culture, religion and power. In the Middle Ages when Zoroastrianism was marginalised and even persecuted despite being an extremely deep-rooted but altogether socially ostracised religion, the term dihqanan continued to be used to refer to the old elite however.

english_billmen	Billmen	Billmen	The bill was a weapon with a long martial tradition in England, it originated with the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons, as a variant of the Danish Axe or pole-axe. It continued to be used in medieval England, predating the adaptation of farming tools into halberd-like weapons in mainland Europe and Russia. The weapon was extremely effective against both infantry and cavalry but required discipline, extensive technical training and unit tactics. For this reason it was fairly uncommon in the early period, however as heavy cavalry formations required more anti-cavalry infantry and combined with the rise of polearms on the continent, the bill was applied more and more by the organised armies of the English kings. Billmen were also invaluable in that like many English units they were military specialists but commoners, not nobles. Due to its 'older' design it had an advantage over continental polearms in that its blade was extremely heavy, although it was relatively slow in the polearm technique of raking and worse still- short in comparison it had a much greater penetration power against armoured opponents on horse or foot alike. Unlike anti-cavalry weapons and units that used a tight formation, billmen were unique in that they used an open formation and this was due to the actual technique of the weapon which was not linear but lateral and like an axe (or quarterstaff technique which was probably a training form) it used a circular and figure of eight motion. Despite its short staff it was therefore almost impossible for an opposing unit to enter into hand-to-hand combat against an open line of these heavy spinning polearms. It would smash shields, deflect polearms and sever horse limbs and men's heads in a whirlwind.

english_fyrdmen	Fyrdmen	Fyrdmen	The fyrd was an Anglo-Saxon levy with roots in the ancient Germanic tradition of the 'hundred', this was also an administrative division of local government and land, still used today in Scandinavia in fact. The hundred itself refers to the feudal commitment of one warrior being chosen from every 100 members of the population. This chosen man would be the village's best warrior and be equipped by his community with the best weapons and armour they could afford, to help save his life. In the Norman period, a good deal of these chosen men were actually English nobles that had been stripped of their rank and property by the Normans. These nobles became local esquires, gentry, elders and headmen. Which meant that the quality of the fyrd actually improved due to the military experience, knowledge, skills and equipment of the English nobles. The fyrd system dwindled from use rather quickly after the Norman period as the Crown became more powerful, and the use of national armies and standing local militias replaced the old ways.

english_longbowmen	Longbowmen	Longbowmen	The longbow has a strange story which is often misunderstood and misinterpreted in the popular imagination. Nonetheless it has become one of the enduring icons of the Middle Ages and specifically a symbol of English power, dominance and glory. It is a common misconception that the longbow originated in Wales. The longbow or 'warbow' was first used among the Anglo-Saxons and Norse, and it is they who probably introduced it to Britain. The weapon, for some unknown reason, was never really important to pre-medieval warfare and did not have an important role on the battlefield. The Welsh had gained use of it sometime prior to the Norman conquest, and as hillmen and guerrillas used it to excellent effect against armoured professional soldiers -Norman invaders, and it was at this point that its story took on a more recognisable turn, where its military effectiveness was realised. However, the Welsh longbow was in fact a good deal shorter than English traditional longbows, nor was it made of yew but of elm which greatly effected its tension, range and tolerance to the damp British climate. The Welsh longbow, was probably more of a hunting weapon. As a result of the Welsh competency, the English quickly resurrected their own yew warbows, and recruited many of their soldiers from the forests of northern England and Sussex in the early period. As the 'institution' grew, the Welsh also adopted the yew bow, and became key drafts into English service but were by no means superior to the Englishmen who were bound by law to practice archery. In time, the power of the bow in medieval warfare was illustrated on the fields of Agincourt and Crecy with legendary results. Nonetheless, main suppliers of yew were actually from the continent where the bow was also known, however like the pre-medieval usage it never really caught on until the late era, where it was quickly eclipsed by gunpowder weapons. English mercenary longbowmen and soldiers were known in small units even among the Teutonic Order and Iberia, as well as ironically among the 'Scots Guards' of the French. English armies however hailed the weapon, especially since it raised the common man to a level playing field against armoured nobles, particulary the hated French!

irish_skirmishers	Kerns	Ceithern	Kerns were Irish light infantry, who were often called up as mercenaries or militiamen by occupying forces such as Norway, England and Scotland. They were light troops who relied on speed and mobility. Their weapon was the throwing-spear, although later some also used the bow. Their role was to support heavier troops such as the gallowglass. More often than not they wore little or no armour, with nothing but a leather coat and tunic, or in some cases just a loincloth.

kiev_peasant_spearmen	Russian Peasant Spearmen	Zadruga	A zadruga refers to a type of rural community historically common among South Slavs. Originally, generally formed of one family or a clan of related families, the zadruga held its property, herds and money in common, with usually the oldest (patriarch) member ruling and making decisions for the family, though at times he would delegate this right at an old age to one of his sons. Because the zadruga was based on a patrilocal system, when a girl married, she left her parents' zadruga and joined that of her husband. Within the zadruga, all of the family members worked to ensure that the needs of every other member were met. It should be made clear that the zadruga was a socioeconomic entity and only had military functions in the loosest, indirect sense. They were a regular staple of levy soldiers for the army, either as militias or as auxillaries for campaign. In this respect they can be seen in the same light as the Germanic 'hundred' such as the Old English Fyrd.

muslim_conscripts	Irregular conscripts	Mutatawwia	Irregular peasant volunteers, given limited pay for campaigns. They were found in vast numbers in the armies of Egypt especially under the Umayyad period, and were known among the Moors as well as contingents in the Crusades and marching on Constantinople. It is unlikely they had a single ethnic origin, but represented a very basic conscription of Muslims that were given booty in turn for service and could follow an army from their homelands to new pastures. There is some suggestion that the ranks of these men serving in Iberia and with the Egyptian state at various times were mainly of Berber (possibly pagan) origin. Elsewhere it is likely they were Mawali, and potentially pagan Turks.

st_george_light_guard	St.George Guard	Wards of St.George 	The quarterstaff is an ancient peasants' weapon with its own techniques and its own martial art that is still practiced today. The quarterstaff was the stock weapon of England amongst travellers, pilgrims and paupers generally - every man could wield a quarterstaff just as he knew how to wrestle or box, regardless of his class or social status. The quarterstaff was a cheap and effective weapon, mainly in self-defence, it could easily stop a blow from a sword although against axes and spears it was vulnerable. The various stances and techniques associated with the quarterstaff still carry the names of traditional Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Old English saints such as St.Hilda -many of whom were were based on pagan cults, so old and engrained on the national pysche as they are. More recently and more specific however was the cult of St.George, who became popular in England after English ships sailed under the flag of Genoan escorts through the Mediterranean to the Holy Land on the First Crusade, from which time he was heralded as the patron of England and war. Since it was the standard accessory of travellers, it became the veritable symbol of English pilgrims and those who would protect wayfarers from bandits. For this reason it was very common among rural militias. The word 'ward' comes from the Old English word for 'to keep guard' or to 'take care of.' Henry Thomas Riley writing in the 1300s in his 'roll of the wards in policing' concerning the militias in London notes that the Wards met at regular councils: 'It is called a wardmoot on the grounds that it is an assembly by summons of the whole populace of one ward, there being present its headman, the alderman or his lieutenant, for the purpose of correcting faults, or removing nuisances, and for furthering the benefit of that ward. What we call a 'wardmoot' was anciently called a 'folkmoot' among the Saxons. The aldermen have been accustomed to hold their wardmoots at least once, or twice, or many times a year, by virtue of a warrant sent to them by the mayor then in office. Through which it has been the practice to enquire into the degree of peace and tranquillity within each ward, and for the alderman to correct faults presented.' The quarterstaff weapon was in the hands of an Englishman a weapon feared by foreigners well into the late 1600s. It could easily handle an armoured opponent on foot and since it had no blade it was light and perfectly balanced making it a very quick weapon. An English crime report from 1527 states: 'John Strynger late of Babworth, laborour, assaulted Henry Pereson of Babworth with a staff worth 1d. Which he held in both hands, striking him on top of the head so that his brains flowed out and giving him a wound 1 inch deep, 2 inches wide and 3 inches long of which he immediately died.' It was exceptional at  fighting numerous opponents simultaneously, allegedly up to 6 men at a time. It's only weakness was against receiving cavalry charge due to its lack of blade or point, nonetheless in melée it could easily unhorse a rider or break the legs of a steed as easily as a bladed weapon.

timurid_infantry	Timurid infantry	čerīk-e pīāda	ČERĪK (also jerīk, from Mongol tserig “warrior[s]”), originally troops sent by an individual or camp (yort) to serve in the royal army). The čerīk system persisted in Iran for many centuries, in slightly varying forms. Jovaynī referred to the element drawn from settled areas and probably not of Mongol stock as čerīk-e pīāda (infantry), as opposed to the mounted Mongol cavalry. Čerīk service was compulsory: Naḵjavānī reported that since ancient times each yort was supposed to supply a number of men from a specific age group (čerīk yortčī) for the Mongol armies but that many tried to avoid such service. According to Jovaynī, the Mongol governors Mahmud Yalavāj and his son Masʿūd Beg abolished “compulsory service (muʾan) in the levies (ḥashar) and the cherig” in Transoxania for political reasons.  In the 7th-8th/13th-14th centuries the term čerīk was used mainly in the sense of “army,” and čerīkčī referred to an individual soldier (Rašīd-al-Dīn, Tārīḵ-e ḡāzānī). For military purposes the Mongols had divided their territory into regions called tomans (Pers. tūmān, Mong. tümän), each of which was to supply 10,000 men when called upon; such a contingent was commanded by an amir-e tūmān, each group of 1,000 men by an amir-e hazāra, each group of 100 men by an amīr-e sada, and each group of ten men by an amir-e čerīk (Rašīd-al-Dīn, Tārīḵ-e ḡāzānī). In reality, however, the toman almost always supplied fewer than 10,000 men; for example, two tomans in the region of Isfahan and the toman of Ḵūzestān sent only 1,000 and 277 men of the sedentary population respectively in the case of war (Rašīd-al-Dīn, Tārīḵ-e ḡāzānī). Some have therefore suggested that the term tūmān referred to an area with 10,000 inhabitants, rather than to a fixed levy of soldiers. Nevertheless, Rašīd-al-Dīn consistently uses the word čerīk in the sense of army and also in the collective sense of “the military” (mardom-e čerīk). Nomads also were all liable for military service, but the sedentary population was supposed to supply čerīk; each nine families (about 40 people) were to send one man. The terms čerīk and īl-jārī continued to be used in the sense of “irregular levies” during the Zand period, but apparently payments were no longer collected in cash. Karīm Khan Zand claimed that he could raise 20,000 čerīk in forty days’ time.

timurid_levies	Timurid levies	ḥašar	The term bīgār (corvée and human taxation) was very often used together with the term ḥašar (from Ar. ḥašara “to gather, bring together”) as synonyms (ḥašar and mard-e bīgārī on the construction of a palace). However, the term ḥašar also had different meanings: 1. auxiliary troops, usually peasant levy, mostly used for siege work, or as sappers, and some­times as a reserve (in central Asia in the Uzbek period a Turko-Mongol term qara čerik was used for such auxiliary troops rather than ḥašar); 2. communal help provided by relatives and the members of a village or neighborhood community to one another on various occasions (agricultural works, building of a house, family festivals, etc.). In the Khanate of Bukhara in the 10th-14th/16th-20th centuries, the term bīgār was most­ly replaced by the term mardekār (lit. “time-worker”; cf. mard-ebīgārī), which meant both the duty and a single worker performing it (as a synonym for such worker the term ḥašaṛčī was also used). Some documents, however, mention all three terms side by side: ḥašar, bīgār, and mardekār, and it is not clear what distinction, if any, was made among them.

balinger_ships	Balinger Fleet 	Balinger Fleet 	A type of small, sea-going vessel used in the 1400s. They were distinguished by their lack of a forecastle, and by carrying either a square sail, or a sail extended on a sprit on a single mast. They were generally less than 100 tons, with a shallow draught, and the earlier vessels at least carried 30 or more oars for use in sheltered areas or for close fighting. They were mainly used for coastal trade, but could also be used as transports, carrying around forty soldiers. A statute of 1441 referring to pirate raids on the south coast of England contained a request from the House of Commons of England asking King Henry VI to provide: eight ships with four stages, carrying one with the other 150 men each. Every great ship was to have in its company a barge, with 80 men, and a ballinger, with 40; and there were also to be four pinnances, with twenty-five men in each. An even earlier reference comes in July 1387, when merchants William Terry, John Tutbury and Peter Stellar of Hull, and Walter Were of Grimsby were reported to have: equipped a ship, ballinger and barge at their own expense to arm themselves 'against the king's enemies'.

byzantine_dromons	Dromon Fleet	Dromon Fleet	Dromons could have a crew of 200, 50 on the lower bank, and 100 on the upper bank in two files, together with 50 marines. They had a central tower (xylokastron - Greek: 'wooden castle') near the main mast, from which the marines could use their bows and arrows or throw spears and other projectiles. Dromons were frequently equipped with flamethrowers (siphones, and as such the ships were described as siphonophoroi dromones) that discharged Greek fire and catapults capable of hurling 10 kg projectiles up to 250 meters.

capital_galleys	Capital Fleet	Capital Fleet	Capital ships were the elite of the galley designs and became popular in the 1200s during the height of the Latin states and their trade cartels. Adapting to much more eastern methods, speed and efficiency as well as the crucial factor of wealth and experienced crews allowed for an unrivalled maritime superiority that continued well into the 1500s when the style was largely outdated by the more advanced caravel. But ocean going vessels were not always neccessary in the Mediterrenean and so their use continued.

eastern_ships	Russian Fleet	Lodia fleet	The term Lodia was used to name Russian river, lake or sea vessels until the 15th century. Basic names of crafts in general or certain classes of crafts were: lodia, sudno, korabl, shneka and busa. The terms lodia and sudno were of Slavic origin and usually meant all kinds of crafts, but sometimes they were opposed to the big ships. The appearance of the term korabl among the Slavs was probably connected with the time of the increasing of contacts with Byzantium. The term shneka signified the large sailing-rowing Scandinavian ships, the term busa was used for the sailing ships similar to the cog. As concrete titles of the vessels of the Slavic or Russian origin can be distinguished the following names: cheln, uchan, porom, pavozok, nasad, and strug. The origin of the terms loiva and ushkui was connected with the Finnish languages; skeid and shneka were undoubtedly Scandinavian terms; the terms olyad, dromon and kubara originated from Byzantium. The names galeya and katorga were known in the Mediterranean region and the term busa was widespread on the Baltic sea. Russia's main focus for shipping was very limited, due to Russia's dependence on its vast rivers for transport and trade, it was only really the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea where sea-going vessels were used, and it is here where Scandinavian and Byzantine influences dominated. They were simple, flat-bottomed boats using square-sails and oars, focussing on large load-carrying capacity.

galley_ships	Galley Fleet	Galley Fleet	A galley is a ship that is propelled by oarsmen, used for trade and warfare. Galleys dominated naval warfare in the Mediterranean Sea from the 8th century BC to the development of effective naval gunnery in the 16th century. From the first half of the 14th century the Venetian galere da mercato the 'merchantman galley' was being built in the shipyards of the state-run Arsenal as a combination of state enterprise and private consortiums of export merchants. The ships sailed in convoy, defended by archers and crossbowmen aboard, and later carrying cannon.

mediterranean_barques	Barca Fleet	Barca Fleet	Barca were originally a Muslim design. The word barc appears to have come from the Greek word baris, a term for an Egyptian boat. This entered Latin as barca, which gave rise to the Italian barca, Spanish barco, and the French barge and barque, it also gave rise to brigantines and barquetines. After the Middle Ages it referred specifically to a ship with three or more masts. Barca were a form of barge well-known on the Nile, and occur in heiroglyphs from the time of the pharoahs. They were relatively flat-bottomed and excelled in carrying large heavy loads and cargoes, which made them useful in medieval warfare for transport and military cargo. As riverboats they also had the use of oars and were a precursor to the Greek and Italian biremes. It used a classic square rig making it perfect for Mediterranean and coastal sailing.

        <!--Combat balancing is designed to help bring balance to the player in the most convienant way possible
        Fair warning though, it can have unpredicted results in your campaign balance, however if you feel a particular 
        type of unit is too strong or weak (say cavalry) simply balance here, use very small increments, like tenths-->
